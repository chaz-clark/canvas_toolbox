build_deid_master.py — Build the course-wide de-identification master CSV.

The MISSING PRIMITIVE that sits underneath all keyed / FERPA workflows.

Today, the canvas-toolbox uses:
  - per-assignment keymaps (a student gets a DIFFERENT key per assignment),
  - a flat `.known_names.txt` roster for the scrub pass.

Both work, but they don't give the operator a single, stable, course-wide
identity surface. This tool fixes that — one CSV, one row per enrolled
student, with a stable opaque code the operator can hand to other tools
WITHOUT ever speaking the student's name to the agent or the cloud LLM.

THE COLUMN CONTRACT
  deid_code     — stable opaque code, e.g. S-68BC40 (sha256(user_id)[:6])
  user_id       — numeric id, the source of truth and the key everything joins on
  sortable_name — "Lastname, Firstname" (NEVER read by tools unless explicit)
  withdrawn     — 1 if enrollment state is inactive/completed/deleted else 0
  org_id        — the INSTITUTION's id (Canvas sis_user_id, D2L OrgDefinedId).
                  Stored for the operator's own cross-system lookups; never a key.
                  Added 1.17.0 — additive, and readers use csv.DictReader, so an
                  older master without this column still parses.

  `org_id` is deliberately NOT interchangeable with `user_id`. On the LMS that
  prompted this (#279) the two id spaces had ZERO overlap across a 25-student
  section, so treating either as the other silently misattributes grades.

The `sortable_name` column lets the OPERATOR look up a student in their
LOCAL gitignored file ("find Ada → S-68BC40") and hand the agent / tool
only the code. The tool resolves code → user_id reading ONLY that column.

WHY `withdrawn` MATTERS
  The default Canvas People view shows ACTIVE students only. Final-grade
  analysis, last-engagement audits, and accommodations frequently need
  visibility into students who DROPPED mid-semester (state: inactive /
  completed / deleted). In one pilot: 30 active → 37 total → 7 withdrawn.

FERPA — TIER 2 GITIGNORED
  This file LIVES in the repo but is GITIGNORED. To make that bulletproof,
  the tool writes a `grading/.gitignore` (containing `*`) the first time
  it creates the directory — so even if the operator forgets to add
  `grading/` to their main .gitignore, the directory's own .gitignore
  prevents any tracked commits.

USAGE
  # Build / refresh the master (writes to ./grading/.deid_master.csv)
  uv run python lib/tools/build_deid_master.py

  # Custom prefix (default S-)
  uv run python lib/tools/build_deid_master.py --prefix DS-

  # Custom output location
  uv run python lib/tools/build_deid_master.py --out /path/to/master.csv

  # Refuse to overwrite an existing master without --force
  uv run python lib/tools/build_deid_master.py --force

  # Dry-run: print the rows that would be written, don't touch the file
  uv run python lib/tools/build_deid_master.py --dry-run

  # If a collision is detected (very rare under ~1000 students), re-run
  # with a longer hash. Default is 6 hex chars; --hash-bits 8 doubles the
  # collision-free range.
  uv run python lib/tools/build_deid_master.py --hash-bits 8

COLLISION MATH (sha256, first N hex chars uppercase, ~birthday paradox)
  6 hex (16M codes): 50 students → 0.007% | 200 → 0.12% | 500 → 0.7% | 1000 → 3%
  8 hex (4B codes):  1000 students → 0.01% | 5000 → 0.3% | 10000 → 1.2%
  10 hex: practically collision-free at any class size.

  # NOT on Canvas? Supply the roster yourself — no credentials needed (#279).
  # See load_roster_json() for the full contract.
  uv run python lib/tools/build_deid_master.py --roster-json grading/roster.json

REQUIRES in .env: CANVAS_API_TOKEN, CANVAS_BASE_URL, CANVAS_COURSE_ID
  ...unless --roster-json is used, which reads no credentials at all.

Resolves issue #109 — course-wide de-id master + per-student
accommodation primitives (the accommodation tool consumes this CSV).
