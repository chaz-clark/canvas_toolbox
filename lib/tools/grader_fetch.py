grader_fetch.py — the new Step 0. Fetches student submissions from Canvas
keyed by user_id (no name in filename), pre-populates .known_names.txt from
the FULL course roster (peer-mention scrub catches non-submitters too), and
by default CHAINS into deidentify + name_leak_check so a fresh
`grader_fetch.py` invocation lands at a fully-de-identified, leak-verified
`submissions_deid/` ready for grading.

Part of the canvas-toolbox generic grader skill (v1.0). See:
  - grading_readme.md (faculty-facing pipeline + canonical layout)
  - lib/agents/canvas_grader.md (agent-facing pipeline)
  - lib/agents/knowledge/grader_knowledge.md §1 (FERPA two-zone architecture)

WHY THIS EXISTS
  The pipeline's old Step 0 was a manual Canvas bulk-download, which
  arrives named `lastnamefirstname_<userid>_<subid>_<title>.ext`. Two
  costs the round-1 ds460 KC1 beta surfaced:

    1. **Manual work** for the instructor every cohort.
    2. **The editor IS the leak.** Those filenames carry student names;
       a single click on a raw file in the IDE injects a name into the
       AI context. Round-1 leaked a name via the IDE's "open file" notice.
       The de-id pipeline is clean; the *named raw files sitting on disk*
       are the hazard.

  The insight that makes this fixable: Canvas's submissions API returns
  `user_id` (a number, not a name) + the attachment URL. So the download
  can be automated AND the name kept out of the filename, the console,
  and the AI entirely.

WHAT IT DOES (default chain — opt out with --no-chain)
  1. Pre-populates `.known_names.txt` from the FULL course roster
     (GET /courses/:id/users?enrollment_type[]=student). This catches
     peer mentions of students who didn't submit too — round-1 KC1
     surfaced cases where a submitter named a non-submitting peer; the
     submitter-only roster missed them. --no-roster opts out.
  2. Lists the assignment's submissions via
     GET /courses/:id/assignments/:aid/submissions?include[]=user
        &include[]=submission_history
  3. For each actual submission (skips no-shows), downloads attachments
     to `<challenge-dir>/submissions_raw/<prefix>_<userid>.<ext>` — NO
     NAME in the filename, EVER.
  4. Fetches the display name from the included `user` object and uses
     it ONLY to:
       - write the local fetch keymap (`.fetch_log.json` — gitignored,
         never read by the AI)
       - append it to `.known_names.txt` (the peer-mention scrub roster,
         deduplicated, gitignored, never read by the AI)
  5. AUTO-CHAIN (default): detects the submission file type and runs:
       a. grader_deidentify_docx.py    (if .docx submissions)
       b. grader_deidentify_databricks.py  (if .html with Databricks marker)
     followed by grader_name_leak_check.py. Any leak surface beyond the
     known set → non-zero exit; the operator MUST investigate before
     letting the AI read submissions_deid/.
  6. Prints keys + counts ONLY. Never a name to stdout/stderr.

FERPA / SECURITY BOUNDARY — read this before changing anything
  * The student name is fetched from Canvas, used locally, and is NEVER
    printed, logged, written into a filename, or sent to any cloud
    surface. The .known_names.txt and .fetch_log.json files are
    gitignored by the scaffold/grading/.gitignore convention.
  * `print()` calls in this file MUST NOT include a student name. Always
    use the `<prefix>_<userid>` filename or the user_id alone.
  * Test Student validation: when --test-student-only is set, the tool
    only downloads submissions whose display name is exactly
    "Test Student" — the standard Canvas test-user. Use this on every
    new assignment FIRST to validate the path before fetching real
    cohort data.
  * Canvas user_id is an internal database number, not a SIS/student
    ID. Printing it is safe under FERPA (FERPA protects directory info
    + grades, not the LMS's own row IDs).

THE NEW STEP 0
  grader_fetch.py replaces the manual Canvas bulk-download. Everything
  downstream is unchanged: deidentify reads from submissions_raw/, push
  resolves the user_id from the filename via the existing regex.

USAGE

    --challenge-dir grading/kc1 \\
    --assignment-id 345678 \\

  # Full cohort fetch (after Test Student validates clean)
  uv run python lib/tools/grader_fetch.py \\
    --challenge-dir grading/kc1 \\
    --assignment-id 345678 \\
    --prefix kc1

  # Re-download a cohort (e.g., after late submissions came in)
