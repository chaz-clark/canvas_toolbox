_override_recalc_helper.py — Shared helper for forcing Canvas assignment
override recalculation.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  Canvas doesn't always automatically trigger SubmissionLifecycleManager.recompute_users_for_course
  when overrides are created or modified via the REST API. This helper provides reusable
  functions that other tools can call to force recalculation after creating/updating overrides.

USAGE FROM OTHER TOOLS
  from _override_recalc_helper import force_recalc_for_student

  # After creating/updating a student override
  force_recalc_for_student(
      base=base_url,
      headers=headers,
      course_id=123456,
      student_id=900003,
      assignment_id=123456  # optional - recalc just this assignment
  )

ARCHITECTURE
  This helper is used by:
  - student_late_accommodation.py
  - student_quiz_time_extension.py
  - apply_sas_accommodations.py
  - fix_group_override_recalc.py (the standalone troubleshooting tool)

  The fix_group_override_recalc.py tool remains the user-facing troubleshooting
  command when manual intervention is needed. This helper provides the same
  recalculation logic for programmatic use.

HOW IT WORKS
  "Touches" the assignment override by performing a no-op PUT (re-sets the same values).
  This triggers Canvas's assignment_override_updated event, forcing recalculation.

RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENTS (v1.6.1)
  - Exponential backoff for 429 rate limiting errors
  - Optional verification that override was actually updated (workaround for Canvas Issue #1774)
  - Parallel processing for multi-assignment recalc (when appropriate)
