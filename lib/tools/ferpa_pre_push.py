"""pre-push FERPA guard — the git layer (#285).

WHY THIS EXISTS
  `grade_guardian` stops the AGENT reading or shell-reading a Zone-2 file. Nothing
  stopped the same data reaching a remote. All three incidents in the constitution's
  record are agent-side; that isn't evidence the git layer is safe, only that it
  hasn't been exercised. And unlike a bad read, **a push cannot be undone** — it is
  cloned, cached and indexed by things you don't control.

WHY NOT JUST A pre-commit HOOK
  A commit hook catches a mistake as you make it and misses: anything committed
  before the hook existed, anything committed with --no-verify, anything committed
  on another machine, and anything correct at commit time that a LATER ignore-rule
  change exposes. That last one is the one that actually happened: a consumer
  inverted a grading ignore block from deny-with-allowlist to source-tracked-by-
  default, and the blanket line removed had been the sole cover for three other
  name-bearing paths. Nothing about that sequence is visible to a commit hook. It is
  visible at push.

  So this checks the COMMIT RANGE, not the working tree. History is what gets
  published; a later commit deleting a file does not unpublish it.

ONE PATTERN LIST, NOT TWO
  Patterns come from `grade_guardian.load_zone2()` — the same `.claude/ferpa_zone2.txt`
  the agent-layer hook reads. A second list would drift, which is the exact bug 1.16.0
  fixed one layer down after `_FERPA_PATH` and `_FERPA_FILE` had already diverged.

GRADED, NOT ALL-ON
  Path checks run by default: cheap, deterministic, near-zero false positives.
  Content scans are OPT-IN (`touch .claude/ferpa_scan_content`) because a roster
  surname scan blocks on any tracked file containing a common surname — ordinary
  prose, citations and package names all trip it, and for an operator who can't read
  the regex that's an unexplainable wall in front of their own work.

  It never silently degrades. If a scan is skipped, it says so — a guard that quietly
  does less is the same false confidence #278 was filed about.

FILENAMES ARE WITHHELD FROM OUTPUT
  A matched path may itself carry a student name (`submissions_raw/Lastname_First…`).
  The report names the PATTERN and the containing directory, never the leaf, and
  tells the operator how to list them locally.

HOW GIT INVOKES IT
  Installed at `.git/hooks/pre-push` by cb_update. Git pipes
  `<local ref> <local sha> <remote ref> <remote sha>` lines on stdin. Exit non-zero
  blocks the push. Fails OPEN on internal error — a guardrail must never brick a repo.

  NOT via `core.hooksPath`: that is consulted INSTEAD OF `.git/hooks/`, so setting it
  makes an existing `.git/hooks/pre-commit` inert (and `pre-commit install` then
  refuses to run). Installing to the path git already reads avoids that entirely, and
  cb_update is itself the per-clone step, which is what "hooks aren't cloned" needs.
