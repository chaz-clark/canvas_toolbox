"""
FERPA leak self-check on de-identified outputs.

Part of the canvas-toolbox generic grader skill (v1.0). See:
  - grading_readme.md (faculty-facing pipeline + canonical layout)
  - lib/agents/canvas_grader.md (agent-facing pipeline)
  - lib/agents/knowledge/grader_knowledge.md (FERPA architecture, §1)

WHAT IT DOES
  Reads two sources of name tokens:

  1. .known_names.txt — the roster (populated by grader_fetch.py's roster
     pre-fetch + by deid runs accumulating submitter names). Each entry is
     DECOMPOSED into full name + each individual part ≥3 chars (same as the
     deid scrub since #47), so prose mentions of first-name-only or
     last-name-only also get caught.

  2. The original Canvas-download filename (LEGACY path) — when the filename
     follows the old Canvas pattern `<lastnamefirstname>_<subid>_<attid>_<title>.<ext>`
     (4+ underscore-separated parts), the first field is a real name. Tokens
     ≥4 chars from that field are added to the search set.

     For new-style `grader_fetch.py` filenames (`<prefix>_<userid>.<ext>` —
     exactly 2 underscore-separated parts, second part numeric; or 3 parts
     for multi-attachment `_a`/`_b` suffix), the filename carries NO name —
     the roster from .known_names.txt is the only authority. The prefix
     token extraction is SKIPPED for those files (issue #49 fix — pre-fix,
     a prefix like `p1t1-cohesive` would extract "cohesive" as a token and
     match every submission's body, generating uniform false positives).

  Scrubs are checked with WORD-BOUNDARY MATCHING (same regex as #47's
  name_aware_subn) — so "Sam" doesn't match "Samsung", "Sam" doesn't match
  "samurai", etc. Pre-#49 the check used bare `text.count()` substring
  matching, which would re-introduce false positives after #47.

  Prints ONLY keys + counts to stdout — never a name — so it's safe to run
  in a shared terminal / with an AI watching. A "possible hit" means the
  agent should STOP and the operator should review that file locally
  (the operator knows the keymap; the AI does not).

  This is the gate before any cloud step. If any flag fires, STOP (P-003).
  Exit code 2 on any flagged file; 1 on missing-only; 0 on clean.
