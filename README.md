# Canvas Course Toolkit

A set of tools that lets you manage your Canvas course like a document — pull it down to your computer, make changes, push it back. Your course structure becomes auditable, reviewable, and fixable without living in the Canvas UI.

Built at BYU-Idaho, designed for all instructors. Works with any Canvas institution.

---

# What you can do with it

- **Keep your course in sync** — pull your Canvas course to a local folder, edit content in any text editor, push changes back
- **Catch problems before students do** — audit for broken module structure, items students can't find, and empty modules
- **Validate your dates** — check that due dates are in the right window, in the right order, and not accidentally duplicated
- **Check your outcome chain** — see whether your course outcomes actually connect to what you're grading
- **Find unused files** — surface files sitting in Canvas that nothing links to
- **Roll out a new semester** — sync your master course to a Blueprint and let Canvas handle section distribution

# Getting started

Choose the path that fits your situation:

---

## Option A — Simplest: open in Antigravity (no terminal required)

1. Go to [github.com/chaz-clark/canvas_toolbox](https://github.com/chaz-clark/canvas_toolbox), click the green **Code** button, then click **Download ZIP**
2. Extract the ZIP to your course folder
3. Open the extracted folder in Antigravity (or any AI coding tool — see the "Using with AI coding tools" section below)
4. Ask the agent: *"Help me set up this toolkit for my Canvas course"*

The agent reads the toolkit's setup instructions automatically and will ask you for what it needs as you go.

---

## Option B — With git: stays updatable

Use this if you want to pull toolkit updates later with a single command. Requires a terminal.

**Open a terminal:**
- **Mac:** press Cmd + Space, type "Terminal", press Enter
- **Windows:** press the Windows key, type "PowerShell", press Enter

All commands below are typed into the terminal and run by pressing Enter.

**Step 1 — Install uv** (it manages Python for you)

Mac or Linux:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Close and reopen your terminal after installing.

**Also needed: git** — already installed on Mac. Windows users: download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), which installs git for you.

**Step 2 — Download the toolkit**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaz-clark/canvas_toolbox.git canvas_toolbox
```

A `canvas_toolbox` folder will appear in your current directory.

**Step 3 — Install dependencies**

```bash
cd canvas_toolbox
uv sync
cd ..
```

uv downloads everything the toolkit needs. This only runs once.

**Step 4 — Create your configuration files**

```bash
cp canvas_toolbox/scaffold/.env.example .env
cp canvas_toolbox/scaffold/gitignore .gitignore
```

This creates a `.env` file in your folder — you'll fill it in next.

**Step 5 — Enter your Canvas credentials**

You'll need three things before this step:
- **Course ID:** open your Canvas course — it's the number in the URL after `/courses/`
- **API token:** Canvas → Account → Settings → Approved Integrations → New Access Token (requires instructor or admin role)
- **Institution URL:** your Canvas login address (e.g., `https://byui.instructure.com`)

Open the `.env` file in a plain-text editor:
- **Mac:** right-click the file → Open With → TextEdit
- **Windows:** right-click the file → Open With → Notepad

> **Can't see the `.env` file?** Its name starts with a dot, which hides it by default. **Mac:** press Cmd + Shift + . in Finder to show hidden files. **Windows:** in File Explorer, click View → check "Hidden items".

```
CANVAS_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
CANVAS_BASE_URL=https://byui.instructure.com
CANVAS_COURSE_ID=123456
```

Save and close the file.

**Step 6 — Pull your course into a local folder**

**Ask your agent:** *"Pull my Canvas course into a local folder so I can start working with it"*

Approve the run of:
```bash
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/canvas_sync.py --init
```

This copies your entire Canvas course — all modules, pages, assignments, quizzes, discussions, and syllabus — into a `course/` folder on your computer. It may take a minute. When it finishes, you'll see the `course/` folder appear.

---

## Option C — A colleague is setting it up for you

You just need to gather three pieces of information and hand them over:

- **Course ID:** open your Canvas course — it's the number in the URL after `/courses/`
- **API token:** Canvas → Account → Settings → Approved Integrations → New Access Token (requires instructor or admin role)
- **Institution URL:** your Canvas login address (e.g., `https://byui.instructure.com`)

Share them in this format:

```
CANVAS_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
CANVAS_BASE_URL=https://byui.instructure.com
CANVAS_COURSE_ID=123456
```

They'll handle the rest.

---

From here, edit any file locally and push changes back to Canvas.

# Auditing your course

Four questions the audit tools can answer. All of them are read-only — they report findings but never change anything in your course. Run them as often as you like.

**Not sure where to start?** Run the first one below.

## "Are there items students can't find?"

**Ask your agent:** *"Run the course quality check and tell me what it finds"*

Approve the run of:
```bash
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/course_quality_check.py
```

Checks for:
- Items published but not linked to any module (students can't navigate to these)
- Duplicate assignments, quizzes, or module items
- Empty modules
- Due dates outside the course date window

## "Are my dates going to confuse anyone?"

**Ask your agent:** *"Check my course due dates for any problems"*

Approve the run of:
```bash
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/course_quality_check.py --validate-dates
```

Checks for:
- Due dates outside the course start/end window
- Lock dates that come before the due date (students lose access before the deadline)
- Two items in the same group sharing the same due date
- Items named "Week 3" or "Sprint 2" whose due date falls in a different week or sprint

Exits with an error code when problems are found — safe to run as a pre-push check.

## "Do my outcomes connect to what I'm grading?"

**Ask your agent:** *"Audit my course for outcome alignment gaps"*

Approve the run of:
```bash
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/course_quality_check.py --alignment
```

Walks the chain: Course Outcome → Module Outcome → Rubric Criterion. Flags:
- Course-level outcomes that no assessment evidences
- Rubric criteria that no upstream outcome justifies
- Module outcomes with no rubric coverage

> Note: this uses text-matching, so treat results as a starting point for review rather than a definitive bug list.

## "Are there files I'm not using?"

**Ask your agent:** *"Find any unused or orphaned files in my Canvas course"*

Approve the run of:
```bash
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/course_quality_check.py --files
```

Cross-references everything linked from your course content against what's actually in Canvas Files. Flags:
- Orphaned files — in Canvas but nothing links to them
- Broken references — linked from content but the file was deleted
- Likely duplicates — same filename, different IDs

Read-only — nothing is deleted automatically.

---

# Syncing your course

## The basic loop

**Ask your agent:** *"Pull my course, show me what's changed, then push my updates to Canvas"*

Approve the run of each step:
```bash
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/canvas_sync.py --pull     # pull course into course/
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/canvas_sync.py --status   # see what's changed locally
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/canvas_sync.py --push     # push changes to Canvas
```

Always run `--status` before `--push` so you know exactly what will change.

## What gets pulled

| Content type | Format | Editable locally |
|---|---|---|
| Pages | `.html` | Yes |
| Assignments | `.json` | Yes — description, points, due date |
| Discussions | `.json` | Yes — title, body |
| Quizzes | `.json` | Yes — description, metadata |
| ExternalTool / SubHeader / ExternalUrl | `.json` | No — manage in Canvas UI |

Not pulled: gradebook, submissions, student data.

## Downloading files referenced in your course

**Ask your agent:** *"Download all the files referenced in my course"* or *"Find the rubric file in my Canvas files"*

Approve the run of:
```bash
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/canvas_sync.py --pull-files          # download all referenced files
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/canvas_sync.py --find-file "rubric"  # search by name, no download
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/canvas_sync.py --pull-file "rubric"  # search + pick + download
```

Files land at `course/_files/`. The toolkit warns you before downloading large batches:

| Total size | What happens |
|---|---|
| Under 50 MB | Downloads automatically |
| 50 MB – 1 GB | Shows a summary and asks you to confirm |
| Over 1 GB | Shows the full file list before proceeding |

---

# Multi-course setup (optional)

For programs using Canvas Blueprints to distribute content to sections:

```
Source course   ← where you author content
      ↓ course_mirror.py
Master course   ← clean template
      ↓ blueprint_sync.py
Blueprint       ← Canvas clones new sections from this
```

```bash
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/blueprint_sync.py --pull    # mirror blueprint locally
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/blueprint_sync.py --status  # see what's changed
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/blueprint_sync.py --push    # sync master → blueprint
```

If you only have one course, ignore this entirely — `canvas_sync.py` is all you need.

# Using with AI coding tools

This repo ships an `AGENTS.md` that any modern AI coding tool loads automatically as project context. Open the repo in your tool of choice and ask *"what can you do for me?"* — the course audit agent's capabilities are built in.

| Tool | How it loads |
|---|---|
| Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, Codex, Aider, Windsurf, Zed, Amp | Automatic — just open the repo |
| VS Code + Copilot | Set `chat.useAgentsMdFile: true` once in user settings |

The agent can audit your course against ten instructional-design frameworks (Cognitive Load, Hattie 3-Phase, Three Domains, BYUI Taxonomy Explorer, Experiential Learning, Designer Thinking, Course Design Language, Toyota Gap Analysis, CLO Quality, and Inverted Bloom's) and propose specific changes with before/after previews.

---

# BYUI course structure conventions

The toolkit enforces this module order:

1. **Overview page** — outcomes, estimated time, how the pieces connect
2. **Content** — readings, videos, demos
3. **Teach One Another** — discussion where students explain or apply to peers
4. **Prove It** — assignment, quiz, or milestone demonstrating mastery

Module naming: `Sprint X: Topic (WXX–WXX)` or `Week X: Topic`.

---

# Troubleshooting

**`--pull` returns empty modules** — check that `CANVAS_COURSE_ID` is correct and your token has instructor access.

**Push returns 403** — your token is read-only or student-level. Generate a new one from an instructor or admin account in Canvas → Account → Settings.

**`--status` shows everything changed right after `--pull`** — re-run `--pull` (it's safe to run again). The toolkit needs one extra pull to finish recording which files it just downloaded.

**Page looks wrong in Canvas after push** — Canvas adds its own CSS wrapper. The `.html` files store body content only. Check the result in Student View, not the editor.

**Quality check shows "published not in module"** — the item exists in the course but was never added to a module. Students can't navigate to it. Add it via Canvas UI or contact your instructional designer.

# Technical reference

## canvas_quiz_questions.py — classic quiz questions

Manages questions for classic Canvas quizzes (not NewQuiz) from a local JSON file:

```bash
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/canvas_quiz_questions.py --push course/.../quiz.questions.json
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/canvas_quiz_questions.py --list course/.../quiz.questions.json
uv run python canvas_toolbox/lib/tools/canvas_quiz_questions.py --clear course/.../quiz.questions.json
```

Question file format:
```json
{
  "canvas_quiz_id": 5911959,
  "course_id": "415322",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question_name": "Short label",
      "question_text": "Full question shown to student.",
      "question_type": "multiple_choice_question",
      "points_possible": 1,
      "answers": [
        {"answer_text": "Correct answer", "answer_weight": 100},
        {"answer_text": "Wrong answer",   "answer_weight": 0}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported types: `multiple_choice_question`, `true_false_question`, `short_answer_question`, `multiple_answers_question`, `essay_question`.

Note: `canvas_quiz_id` and `course_id` are course-specific — the same quiz has a different ID in every course and section. Push to each course separately.

## Keeping canvas_toolbox in sync across courses

The standard pattern: each Canvas course gets its own git repo, and `canvas_toolbox/` lives inside it as a plain clone. Toolkit updates flow downstream; your course content is never touched.

```bash
# Update the toolkit in any course repo
cd canvas_toolbox && git pull origin main && cd ..
```

Only files under `canvas_toolbox/lib/`, `canvas_toolbox/scaffold/`, and `canvas_toolbox/examples/` change on a pull. Your `course/`, `.env`, and everything at your repo root are untouched.

## Canvas API gotchas

- **Module prerequisites** — use form-encoded `data={"module[prerequisite_module_ids][]": id}`, not JSON. JSON returns 200 but silently does nothing.
- **Completion requirements** — must be set on every item in a module for the prerequisite lock to enforce. `must_submit` for assignments/quizzes, `must_view` for pages/tools/URLs.
- **Classic quiz points** — Canvas may show 0 after questions are pushed. Fix with `PUT /quizzes/:id {"quiz": {"points_possible": N}}`.
- **late_policy PATCH** — returns 403 for instructor tokens. Set manually in Canvas Settings → Gradebook.
- **IDs are course-specific** — the same assignment has a different ID in every course and section. Always match content across courses by title, never by ID.
- **Content + module = two steps** — creating an assignment or page makes it exist in the course but students can't access it until it's also added as a module item.
