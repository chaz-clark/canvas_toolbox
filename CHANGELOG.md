## [1.22.0] — 2026-08-15

**Course dates push — and are verified, because Canvas may silently ignore them (#182).**

`--migrate-from` (#294) made semester migration one command except for course dates, which still needed a manual trip to the Canvas UI. `_course.json` carried `start_at`/`end_at` and `--push` ignored them.

- **`cmd_push` now writes course dates** via `PUT /courses/:id` when they change in `_course.json`.
- **The write is confirmed by reading it back**, and this is the point rather than a nicety. Many institutions enable the account setting `prevent_course_availability_editing_by_teachers`, under which Canvas **returns 200 and keeps the old dates** for a teacher token — the operator who requested this feature hit exactly that ("dates not updated", no error). A fire-and-forget PUT would print *"✓ Course dates updated"* while nothing happened, which is #182's original bug — push claims success, the edit is discarded — reproduced one layer out. When the dates don't stick, the output names the account setting and points at Canvas → Settings → Course Details.
- **`restrict_enrollments_to_course_dates` now round-trips too.** Without it, course dates govern nothing — the term dates win — so setting dates alone can "succeed" and change nothing an instructor can see.
- **Timestamps are compared by instant, not string.** Canvas may echo an equivalent-but-differently-formatted date; a textual compare would report a successful write as a failure and send someone to their admin for nothing.
- **`course_hash` only advances when everything round-trips.** Advancing it after a partial push is what made a discarded edit look clean in the first place.
- `_course_late_policy_hash` → **`_course_pushable_hash`**, now covering late_policy *and* dates. #182's invariant is unchanged: the hash must cover exactly what push writes — too much and an unpushable edit (a course rename) shows as modified forever, too little and a real edit is silently dropped. Both directions are pinned by tests.

## [1.21.2] — 2026-08-14

**`grade_guardian` read a docstring as evidence of a grade write (#297).**

A legitimate course-setup script — creating unpublished Classic Quiz mirrors, writing no grades or comments — was blocked. The trigger was a line of **prose in its own docstring**:

> *"the missed-stand-up justification comes in as a Canvas submission COMMENT instead"*

`_CANVAS_CTX` carried a `canvas.*submission` catch-all that matched any line containing both words. The script's documentation of what it deliberately does **not** do was read as evidence that it does, and the operator had to run it outside Claude Code — defeating the point of the hook.

- **Comments and docstrings are stripped before a body is matched.** The run-catch reads source looking for grade-write *code*; prose isn't executable and can't be evidence. Real payload literals (`"posted_grade"`) are kept — only `#` comments and bare-expression docstrings go. Fails open on anything unparseable, so a syntax error or a non-Python file can never quietly disable the check.
- **`canvas.*submission` is replaced** with `/assignments/<anything>/submissions`, which matches the endpoint whether the ids are literal or interpolated in an f-string — the case the catch-all actually existed for — without matching English.

**Deliberately not implemented:** the issue's Option 1 (whitelist by script name) and Option 3 (marker comment). Both are bypass vectors — an agent routing around the guard would name its script accordingly or add the marker. That trades a false positive for a hole in the guard's entire purpose.

*A near-miss worth recording:* the first implementation rebuilt the source from tokens, which re-joined `requests.put(` as `requests . put (` and stopped `_WRITE_VERB` matching — silently disabling the guard completely. All three bypass fixtures passed straight through. The fix blanks spans in place so offsets survive; a test now pins it.

---

## [1.21.1] — 2026-08-14

**The three things a semester migration trips over on the way in (#294 related).**

- **Pull no longer crashes on an empty course.** Canvas sends an explicit `null` for empty rich-text fields, and `.get(key, "")` only defaults when the key is **absent** — a present-but-null passes `None` straight through to `write_text()`. An empty course nulls `syllabus_body`, which is the first thing a semester migration pulls.

  Fixed the whole class rather than the reported instance: the same shape appears in **15 places** across `description`, `message` and `body`, so an assignment with no description, a discussion with no message, or a blank homepage crashed identically. All now use `.get(key) or ""`.

- **A missing `markdown` package now says what to do.** It's a declared dependency, so `ModuleNotFoundError` on `--build` means the vendored toolkit was never synced after a pull — but the bare traceback sends people hunting for a package instead of running `cd canvas-toolbox && uv sync`.

- **A stale-id push failure now names the fix.** Canvas answers a cross-course `PUT` with *"The specified resource does not exist"*, which reads like the assignment was deleted rather than like the ids belong to a different course. Four courses lost time to that before anyone identified it. The error now points at `--rebind` / `--migrate-from` with the current course id filled in — printed **once per run**, since 52 failing assignments would otherwise bury it 52 times.

---

## [1.21.0] — 2026-08-14

**Semester migration: `--rebind` and `--migrate-from` (#294).**

`canvas_id` is course-specific, so pull from course A and push to course B and every write becomes `PUT /courses/B/assignments/<A's id>` → *"The specified resource does not exist."* Four courses hit this in one week — 52, 131, 44 and 71 items — and it recurs three times a year plus on every master→section promotion.

- **`canvas_sync.py --rebind NEW_COURSE_ID`** matches local sync state against the target course and re-points every id. Pages match on `page_url` (a real slug); assignments, quizzes and discussions match on title — exact first, then case/whitespace-normalized. Rewrites both places the id lives: `.canvas/index.json` **and** the markdown frontmatter. Dry-run by default.
- **`canvas_sync.py --migrate-from OLD --to NEW --apply`** has Canvas copy the course (`course_copy_importer`), polls to completion, then rebinds. For the empty-course case, which is the normal one each semester.
- **Ambiguous matches are refused, never guessed.** A duplicate title on either side stops that item and reports it. A wrong remap silently aims every future push — and any grade sync — at the wrong assignment, and nothing surfaces until someone spots marks on the wrong item. Unmatched and unidentifiable items are reported too; nothing is dropped silently.
- **Stale `module_item_id` / `module_canvas_id` are cleared** on rebound entries rather than carried over. They belong to the old course, and a stale id is worse than an absent one because it looks valid.
- **The course guard checks the TARGET**, not `CANVAS_COURSE_ID` — guarding the env var would verify the course you're migrating *away from*. `--migrate-from --apply` is guarded as a **write** (it creates content); `--rebind` as a read.

**Why Canvas does the copying.** Stripping the ids and letting push create fresh was tried in the field and failed 44/44 with *"no canvas_id in index"* — every writer in `canvas_sync` is update-only, and there is no create path. Nor should there be: New Quizzes can't be created or edited through the classic API at all (`canvas_sync` already refuses them with *"Canvas-only: must be edited in Canvas UI"*), and a hand-rolled create path would silently drop them along with rubrics, question banks and file attachments. Both field workarounds — `create_content_migration()` and `.imscc` export/import — independently converged on Canvas's own copy. So Canvas creates the content; the toolkit re-points local state at it.

*Verified against the live DS 460 migration: guard flagged the target correctly, 5 pages matched by slug, and it reported exactly the 52 unmatched assignments named in the issue.*

## [1.20.4] — 2026-08-07

**`~/.canvas/config` is now `source`-able, and ad-hoc scripts are told how to load it (#288 follow-up).**

Two field agents independently ran `source ~/.canvas/config && python …` and got nothing. A plain `KEY=value` line sources into a **shell variable**, which no child process inherits — so the token was there and invisible. Both concluded it was missing; one offered to put a token back in `.env`.

The toolkit never noticed because it parses the file directly. The gap only appears for everything *outside* the toolkit — ad-hoc scripts, and course-local `tools/*.py` that read `os.environ` after loading `.env`. Those worked before consolidation and silently stopped afterward. That class of consumer wasn't considered when the migration was designed.

- **The file is written with `export`.** Sourcing now works, and python-dotenv parses the prefix unchanged, so one file serves the toolkit, the shell, and any script that reads `os.environ`.
- **`cb_update` adds the missing prefix to an existing config** (`--apply`), preserving comments and re-asserting `0600`. Idempotent; a commented-out line is left alone.
- **The pointer block gives agents the two-line idiom** for loading credentials in an ad-hoc script, and states plainly that `env | grep CANVAS` showing only `CANVAS_BASE_URL`/`CANVAS_COURSE_ID` is normal — the token isn't exported into a session, and its absence there proves nothing. Both agents treated that output as evidence of misconfiguration.

*Verified end-to-end: `source ~/.canvas/config` → child process sees the token → Canvas returns 200.*

---

## [1.20.3] — 2026-08-07

**Tell agents where the Canvas token actually lives (#288 follow-up).**

A field agent opened a course `.env`, found no `CANVAS_API_TOKEN`, and reported *"API Token: Missing — Canvas is not accessible."* The token was resolvable the whole time; the toolkit in that repo returns it correctly from `~/.canvas/config`. Nothing told the agent that file exists.

Worse, its proposed fix was to add a token back into `.env` — which would shadow the global file and silently reinstate the stale-copy problem consolidation removed. One helpful agent could undo the migration on a repo and nobody would notice until a token rotation.

- The **pointer block** injected into every consumer `AGENTS.md` now states the resolution order (environment variable → repo `.env` → `~/.canvas/config`), says plainly that a `.env` without a token is the *expected* state on a multi-course machine, and forbids adding one back.
- It directs agents to check reachability by running `cb_update` and reading its `token check:` line rather than inspecting files — and notes that `REJECTED` most often means the token needs **accepting** in Canvas settings, since it stays listed as active the entire time it doesn't work.
- The block is self-healing, so every consumer picks this up on their next `cb_update` without touching course-specific content. Verified against a real consumer `AGENTS.md`: detected as stale, refreshed, idempotent on re-run.

*No code changed — the credential path was already correct. What was missing was any way for an agent to know it.*

---

## [1.20.2] — 2026-08-07

**The credential guard denied its own documented escape hatch (#288 follow-up).**

The denial message tells operators to inspect key names with `grep -o '^[A-Z_]*=' <file>`. A field agent ran exactly that, piped to `head -10`, and was blocked — because `head` appeared *somewhere* in the command and the check scanned the whole string. A guard that refuses the command its own message recommends teaches people it's arbitrary, and that's how one stops being respected.

- **The check is now per-segment.** A pipeline/compound command is split on `|`, `;`, `&&`, `||`, and only the segment that actually names the credential file is judged. `grep -o … | head` passes because the only thing reaching `head` is key names; `cat file | head` still blocks because the segment touching the file *is* the raw read.
- **Plain `grep` on a credential file now blocks** unless it's the sanctioned anchored key-name form. `grep '' ~/.canvas/config` prints every line, token included — "it's only a grep" was never safe. This hole predates the segment change; writing the test table is what surfaced it.
- **Content filters count as reads** on credential files: `cut`, `awk`, `sed`, `tr`, `xargs`. `cut -d= -f2-` is precisely how you extract a token. Not applied to Zone-2 files, where the constitution explicitly permits the filtered `grep <code> … | cut -f1,2` verification.
- Legitimate operations stay open: `chmod`, `rm`, `test -f`, `wc`, `ls`, `stat`, and grepping source code for the variable name.

25 cases are now pinned in the suite, covering both directions. The one that would have caught the original bug is the denial message's own text, piped — which is the check I should have written when I wrote the message.

---

## [1.20.1] — 2026-08-07

**`cb_update`'s token check was testing the wrong thing (#288 follow-up).**

Five consumer repos reported `token check: REJECTED` on the same day the operator's `curl` against `~/.canvas/config` returned `200`. The tool was right that *something* was wrong and wrong about what.

`cb_update` is not a Canvas tool and never called `load_env()`. `check_token()` read a bare `os.environ` that nothing had populated — so it **never looked at `~/.canvas/config` at all**. On a clean environment it reported `no-token`; where a stale value happened to be present in the process environment, it reported `REJECTED` against that. The credential it was supposed to be verifying was never sent.

A check that tests something other than what the tools use is worse than no check: it sent an operator to regenerate a working token, twice.

- `check_token()` now resolves credentials through `load_env()` first — the same environment variable → repo `.env` → `~/.canvas/config` chain every tool uses. Verified on a real repo: `no-token` before, `valid` after, same file and same token.
- A test pins that the credential actually reaching Canvas is the resolved one, by capturing the `Authorization` header rather than trusting the returned status.

*Also worth knowing:* `load_env()`'s `__file__`-anchored fallback walks up from `lib/tools/` and finds a **vendored toolkit's own `.env`** before the course root's. Consumers don't normally have one, but a maintainer checkout does — and it silently wins over the global file. If `canvas-toolbox/.env` exists on your machine and carries a token, delete that line.

---

## [1.20.0] — 2026-08-06

**One place to rotate the Canvas token — and the guardrails follow it there (#288).**

Canvas now expires API tokens every 29 days across all institutions. An operator running five course repos was editing five `.env` files a month, and the one they forgot 401'd silently until a grading run failed — which is exactly what happened on 2026-08-06, blocking eight courses.

- **`~/.canvas/config` global fallback**, resolved in `_env_loader.load_env()` — the one function all 90 tools already call, whose docstring anticipated precisely this ("a future improvement, e.g. multi-file precedence, lands in ONE place instead of twelve"). Precedence is unchanged and conventional: environment variable → repo `.env` → global. Demoting the env var, as the issue proposed, would have broken CI and one-off `CANVAS_API_TOKEN=x uv run …` overrides.
- **An empty value counts as absent.** `cb_init` scaffolds a bare `CANVAS_API_TOKEN=` into every new repo; treating that as a value would make each new repo shadow the global file with an empty string and break on day one. A real repo in that state already existed in the field.
- **The global file takes an ALLOWLIST — `CANVAS_API_TOKEN`, `CANVAS_BASE_URL` — and never a course id.** This is the safety property, not an oversight. `canvas_course_guard` (#27) exists because a stale `CANVAS_COURSE_ID` silently sends writes to the wrong course; a global one would manufacture that. An allowlist rather than a denylist because one field repo carries **eight** course-id-ish keys (`S1`/`S2`/`S3_COURSE_ID`, `BLUEPRINT_`, `MASTER_`, `PROTECTED_`, `SANDBOX_`), and missing one means grades in the wrong course. A course id in the global file is ignored *and reported*.
- **Parsed with python-dotenv, not by hand.** `export CANVAS_API_TOKEN="1234~ab#cd"` defeats a naive `startswith()`, keeps the quotes, and truncates at the `#` — each silently, leaving "no token found" while the token sits in the file.
- **`cb_update` migrates the installed base**, which is the whole problem — `cb_init` gets new repos right for free. It detects multi-course from sibling repos (directory names only; it never reads another repo's `.env`), consolidates the token, and **comments out** the local copy rather than deleting it. Idempotent and self-consolidating: run it in any repo, in any order, re-run freely. Single-course operators are untouched — a repo tool writing secrets into `$HOME` needs positive evidence, and the detection fails safe toward "single". `--multi-course` / `--single-course` override.
- **When there's no token worth seeding, it scaffolds the file empty at `0600`.** The moment anyone consolidates is the moment their token expired — that's the reason they're there — so every local copy may be stale.
- **`cb_update` now verifies the token** with one read-only `GET /users/self`: `valid` / `REJECTED` / `unreachable` / `no-token`. Consolidating rotation says nothing about whether the token is *current*, so the failure mode was otherwise unchanged. `unreachable` is deliberately distinct from `REJECTED` — reporting a network blip as a bad credential would send someone to regenerate a working one, and `cb_update` has always worked offline. `--no-token-check` opts out.
- The `REJECTED` message names **three causes that are indistinguishable from outside**, led by the one found the hard way: a user-generated token can need **accepting** in Canvas → Account → Settings, and is listed as active the entire time it doesn't work.

### The guardrails moved with the credential

Consolidation made the token a better target: five repo-local gitignored files became one well-known path holding the single credential for every course, outside any repo.

- **`grade_guardian` now covers credentials**, extending the existing hook rather than adding a second one that could be missing or inert. Graded on purpose: `~/.canvas/config` blocks both `Read` and shell display, since it holds a credential and nothing else; `.env` blocks raw shell display only, because blocking `Read` would also block `Edit` (the harness requires a read first), leaving blind whole-file overwrite — worse than the leak it prevents. `.env.example`, `.envrc`, and key-name inspection (`grep -o '^[A-Z_]*='`) stay allowed.
- It catches the form that **actually leaks a token**: not `cat`, but a script calling `.read_text()` and printing. Mistake-proofing that only covered `cat`/`head` would have missed the real incident this was built from and felt safe.
- **The pre-push guard blocks a committed credential too.** A pushed token is worse than a pushed name in one way that matters: it's usable by anyone who finds it, with no institutional relationship required, and revocation is the only remedy.

*Verified end-to-end on a six-repo installation: migration applied, all six resolving the global token, all authenticating.*

## [1.19.1] — 2026-08-04

**Went and looked at what a faculty member actually sees. Found one thing working by accident and one nag that shouldn't exist.**

### The VS Code path works — and now can't silently stop working

A blocked push had never been observed in a GUI, only in a terminal. Read VS Code's git extension (`dist/main.js`) and ran a real blocked push against it. Its error path is `msg = stdout ? lines[last] : lines[0]`, shown in a **modal** dialog with the full text behind *Show Command Output*. So the instructor gets exactly one line of ours, and it happens to be the right one.

That depends on two properties that are invisible in the source and silent to break:

- **The first non-empty stderr line must stand alone.** Add a preamble like "Checking commits…" and the modal shows *that* instead of the denial.
- **The hook must write nothing to stdout.** If stdout is non-empty VS Code takes the *last* line — and git appends its own `failed to push some refs` there. One stray `print()` replaces the whole message with something useless.

Both are now pinned by tests that port VS Code's algorithm verbatim, verified by breaking each property and confirming the suite stops.

### The Zone-2 nudge no longer fires at everyone

1.16.0 shipped a prompt to create `.claude/ferpa_zone2.txt` on any repo lacking it — which is nearly every Canvas course, on every run, forever. The built-in patterns cover a Canvas course completely, so that was homework nobody owed. It's the exact failure #278 was filed about (a guardrail so noisy it gets tuned out), reintroduced one layer up by the fix for it.

Now it fires only where it's actionable: a repo with no Canvas course configured. The pattern **count** still prints everywhere, because that's a fact rather than a chore. A Canvas repo that does keep its own name-bearing files gets pointed at the file by `print_ignore_coverage`, which fires on evidence.

Net for a normal Canvas course: `cb_update` gained one status line across 1.16.0–1.19.0, not four.

---

## [1.19.0] — 2026-08-04

**A FERPA guard on the git layer: `grade_guardian` can't see `git push`, and a push can't be undone (#285).**

The toolkit protected the agent layer well and the git layer not at all. All three incidents in the constitution's record are agent-side — which isn't evidence the git layer is safe, only that it hadn't been exercised.

A `pre-commit` guard isn't sufficient. It misses anything committed before the hook existed, with `--no-verify`, on another machine, or **anything correct at commit time that a later ignore-rule change exposes**. That last one actually happened: a consumer inverted a grading ignore block from deny-with-allowlist to source-tracked-by-default, and the blanket line removed turned out to be the sole cover for three other name-bearing paths. Nothing in that sequence is visible to a commit hook.

- **New `lib/tools/ferpa_pre_push.py`**, installed by `cb_update` at `.git/hooks/pre-push`. Checks the **commit range**, not the working tree — history is what gets published, and a later commit deleting a file doesn't unpublish it. Handles the new-branch case (`--not --remotes`) that a naive `remote..local` gets wrong.
- **One pattern list, not two.** It reads the same `.claude/ferpa_zone2.txt` as `grade_guardian`. A second list would drift, which is precisely the 1.16.0 bug one layer down.
- **Graded, not all-on.** Path checks by default (cheap, deterministic, near-zero false positives). Content scans — uid→name maps, roster surnames — opt-in via `.claude/ferpa_scan_content`, because surname matching trips on ordinary prose, citations and package names, and for an operator who can't read the regex that's an unexplainable wall in front of their own work. It never silently degrades: if a scan is off, the denial says so.
- **The denial is written for the person who hits it.** A blocked push lands on someone trying to share their work, and "rewrite history" is beyond most faculty — so the message leads with the non-destructive fix (a fresh branch from a clean tree), then history rewriting with a caution, then how to narrow a false-positive pattern. A message that only says what's wrong produces `--no-verify`.
- **Filenames are withheld from output.** A matched filename may itself be a student name; the report names directories only.
- **`cb_update` reports name-bearing directories git isn't ignoring** — catching the ignore-restructure class at update time, blocking nothing.

**Not `core.hooksPath`.** The issue proposed it, since hooks aren't cloned. But git consults `core.hooksPath` *instead of* `.git/hooks/`, so setting it makes an existing `.git/hooks/pre-commit` inert — and `pre-commit install` then refuses to run, so it can't be recovered. That would silently disable the ruff/actionlint gate in this repo and any consumer using the pre-commit framework: the same "installed and enforcing nothing" failure #278 was filed about. Installing to the path git already reads has no such collateral, and the not-cloned problem is solved by `cb_update` being the per-clone step. A regression test pins that an existing `pre-commit` hook survives installation.

*Reported, with a working implementation, from a Brightspace course repo.*

## [1.18.0] — 2026-08-04

**The output rule gets the half it was missing: what to write, not just what not to (#280).**

1.15.0 made the FERPA output rule unconditional — codes, never names. Correct for everything written *about* a student, and unworkable for text written *for* one. A discussion reply is name-addressed by construction: the artifact IS the student-facing text, its destination is that student's own thread, and it carries no score.

Filed as a request for a facilitation carve-out; the reporter then withdrew that ask and argued against it themselves, on the grounds that an exception you must classify into at the moment of writing is the wrong shape. Shipping their replacement instead.

- **Zone 2-Adjacent now covers authored outputs, not just files you read.** The tier was defined as "files you legitimately READ that carry names" — all inputs. Student-facing text you WRITE is now explicitly in it, rather than filed there by analogy.
- **The naming convention governs the TEXT, not the file:** given name plus last initial in student-facing text. Documented as **exposure minimization, not de-identification** — in a small section a first name plus an initial usually resolves to one person, and the student's full name is already on the thread the draft is destined for. What it limits is what accumulates in the repo and in transcripts. Labelling it de-identification invites "…therefore it's safe beside a grade," which is the exact boundary this rule exists to hold.
- **Operator-facing scaffolding** — what you need to locate and confirm the right thread — may carry full names, gated on a **necessity-for-navigation test** rather than a field list: if removing it wouldn't make the artifact harder to find, it isn't scaffolding. A peer's name is called out as the sharpest case, since the convention bans peer mentions. Must live under an already-gitignored path, because protection that ships with the directory survives edits to the root ignore file.
- **Operator-supplied names are scoped to the turn.** A name you were just handed may be used conversationally in that turn — repeating it discloses nothing the operator didn't just write, and refusing teaches them the rule is unusable. It must not be persisted beyond it.
- **The hard line is unchanged and unconditional:** a name never appears beside a score, a rubric criterion, a grade band, or a standing.
- The shipped text says plainly that **the judgment call moved rather than disappeared** — from "is this a facilitation draft?" to "is there an evaluation next to this name?" The second is checkable; the first is an inference about intent. A reader told "no classification needed" stops checking.
- The `voicing` skill — loaded whenever student-facing text is drafted — carries the convention, so it's present where the decision is actually made.

## [1.17.0] — 2026-08-04

**The consumer can supply the roster: a documented identifier-map contract for courses with no LMS API (#279).**

`cb_init`/`cb_update` modelled two repo shapes — vendored-into-Canvas, and standalone toolkit. There's a real third: vendored into a course repo with **no Canvas at all**, wanting everything except the Canvas API — the constitution, the skills, `grade_guardian`, the FERPA zone discipline, and the N-pass consensus grading method, none of which touch Canvas.

The follow-up on the issue sharpened it from "declare a mode" to the thing that actually costs manual effort: the toolkit assumes one canonical student identifier because Canvas hands you one. A consumer without an API has several and no authoritative mapping between them.

- **`build_deid_master.py --roster-json <path>`** builds the master from a local file and **reads no credentials at all**. The contract is deliberately the shape Canvas already returns, so everything downstream — deid codes, `.deid_master.csv`, `.known_names.txt`, de-id, re-id, push — works unchanged. Validation is strict and loud (missing `id`/`name`, non-integer `id`, malformed JSON, and **duplicate ids rejected rather than collapsed**): a hand-built identifier map is exactly where a silent error becomes a misattributed grade.
- **New `org_id` column** in `.deid_master.csv` for the institution's id — D2L `OrgDefinedId`, Canvas `sis_user_id`, same concept, so Canvas repos get it populated too. **Stored, never a key.** The reporting consumer measured *zero* overlap between the two id spaces across a 25-student section, so treating them as interchangeable silently misattributes grades. Appended last and readers use `csv.DictReader`, so a master written before this release still parses — no rebuild required.
- **`cb_update` names the third shape** when no Canvas course is configured: which tools are inert, which of the toolkit still fully applies, and the way through (`--roster-json`, `.claude/ferpa_zone2.txt`). It reports what it *observed* rather than asserting a mode — absent credentials aren't proof a course isn't on Canvas, and telling someone their tools are inert when they aren't is its own failure. Silent for configured Canvas repos.

*Reported from a Brightspace course repo running the toolkit since 1.8.0.*

## [1.16.0] — 2026-08-04

**`grade_guardian`'s FERPA set is extensible, and says what it actually covers (#278).**

The Zone-2 pattern set was hardcoded to Canvas workflow filenames with no extension point. A non-Canvas consumer got the hook installed, got told `present`, and was protected against nothing — their name-bearing files had *zero* overlap with the pattern set. As the reporter put it, that line is true and misleading in the same breath: "present" reads as "covered."

- **Course-local `.claude/ferpa_zone2.txt`** — one regex per line, `#` comments, unioned into both matchers. Consumer patterns are never anchored, since over-matching only blocks more reads while under-matching leaks. Invalid patterns are dropped rather than raised (a guardrail must never brick a session) but are reported loudly, because a silently-ignored pattern is the same false confidence in a new costume.
- **`cb_update` prints the active pattern count** and, on a repo with no extension file, names the file to create. "Present" is no longer something the operator has to interpret.
- **One source list, two compiled forms.** `_FERPA_PATH` and `_FERPA_FILE` were two hand-maintained regexes carrying a "kept in sync by hand" comment — and had already drifted: one was case-sensitive, and they disagreed on `.*` vs `[^/\\]*`. Both now derive from one list. **The path form is now case-insensitive**, closing a real hole: on a case-insensitive filesystem (macOS default) `Read .DEID_MASTER.csv` passed a block that `cat` caught.
- **A D2L/Brightspace Classlist export is blocked out of the box.** It's the complete identity join for a section — name, username, email, and institutional id, one row per student — and it's the file most likely to be sitting in a downloads folder. Shipped as a default rather than left to config: the whole complaint is a hook that enforces nothing, and an unconfigured consumer would still be exposed on their most identifying artifact. The course code, term and timestamp around it vary; `Classlist_Export` is D2L's own export naming and doesn't. Costs Canvas repos nothing.

## [1.15.1] — 2026-08-04

**Fix the 1.14.1 gitignore lines, which matched nothing they were meant to match (#277).**

`ensure_gitignore()` emitted `.claude/skills/<name>/` **with a trailing slash**. In gitignore a trailing slash matches *directories only*, and `install_skill_symlinks()` creates **symlinks** — which git treats as files. So the corrected ignore set matched none of the artifacts the tool actually creates: on migration, all eight toolkit skills flipped to untracked, and a `git add -A` would have committed eight symlinks pointing into the gitignored vendored toolkit. Regression introduced by the #271 fix in 1.14.1; shipped in 1.14.1 and 1.15.0.

- **Emit the pattern without a trailing slash.** A slashless pattern matches both the symlink and the real directory of the Windows copy fallback, so it's correct on either install path.
- **Migrate the 1.14.1/1.15.0 lines too**, not just the pre-1.14 blanket line — otherwise every repo that took the last two releases keeps the broken patterns. Multiple legacy lines collapse to one corrected set, in place.
- **The tests now ask real git about a real symlink.** The 1.14.1 tests shelled out to `git check-ignore` but passed it a trailing-slash *path*, which git resolves as a directory — a directory-only pattern matched a directory-shaped query, and the assertion confirmed itself. Two tests now install the actual symlink and assert on `git status --porcelain` of the worktree, pathspec-scoped so the vendored originals can't be mistaken for the links pointing at them. Verified by reintroducing the bug: 6 tests fail, including both real-git ones.

*Reported by a Brightspace consumer running `cb_update --apply` at 1.15.0.*

## [1.15.0] — 2026-07-30

**FERPA output discipline: being allowed to READ a name never makes you allowed to PRINT one (#254).**

The constitution had input discipline (don't read `.deid_master.csv`) but no output rule. A 2026-07-28 field incident exposed the asymmetry: an agent read names out of a *legitimately readable* working file (`_computed_grades.csv`) and printed them next to grades. No read rule can catch that — the read was allowed.

- **New Zone 2-ADJACENT file class** — `_computed_grades.csv`, `_gradebook_canvas.csv`, `_actual_grades.csv`, `FINAL_REVIEW_COMMENTS_*.md`. Read them freely; never echo a name out of them. Fills the gap between "never read" (Zone 2) and unclassified.
- **The output rule is now unconditional** — students are referred to by `user_id`/`deid_code` in every response, summary, table, and commit message, *regardless of which file the name came from*. Added ✅/❌ pairs drawn from the actual incident phrasing.
- The `grading` skill — where the incident happened — names the three working files it has you read and points at the constitution.
- Incident note now records all three (2026-07-01, 2026-07-02 read failures; 2026-07-28 output failure) so the two directions are visibly distinct.

Phases 1–2 of #254. Phase 3 (automated pre-output scanner) is **not** implementable as specified — no Claude Code hook can inspect or block assistant prose — and remains open for a scoped-down design; see the issue thread.

---

## [1.14.1] — 2026-07-30

**`cb_update` no longer gitignores the course's OWN skills (#271, #272).**

`ensure_gitignore()` appended a blanket `.claude/skills/` — right for the toolkit's symlinks, wrong for a skill the course authored in that same folder. `cb_update` already models the distinction (`install_skill_symlinks()` returns `skip-course-owns` for a real directory it must not clobber) and then ignored those directories anyway.

It failed *quietly*: `.gitignore` doesn't affect already-tracked files, so nothing broke at apply time. It bit the **next** course-owned skill added — untracked and ignored, so `git add -A` skipped it, `git status` never listed it, and it was simply never committed. Reported by a non-Canvas consumer (Brightspace) using the toolkit for its knowledge library and skills architecture, with six course-owned skills of its own.

- **Ignore the toolkit's skills by name** (`.claude/skills/grading/`, …) instead of the directory. The ignore set now matches exactly what the tool creates, so anything classified `skip-course-owns` is protected **by construction** rather than by a negation list the consumer has to remember to extend. Fails safe in the right direction too: a newly shipped toolkit skill shows up as a tracked symlink (visible, trivially fixed) instead of a course-owned skill vanishing without a trace.
- **Existing repos are migrated, not just new ones.** The old code returned `present` the moment it saw the blanket line, so a changed emit alone would have fixed only fresh repos and left every already-updated consumer — including the reporter's — broken. `--apply` now replaces a legacy blanket line in place (`migrated`), preserving surrounding entries and any consumer-added negations.
- Consumers who added negations or a `pre-commit` guard as a workaround can keep them; they're harmless once the blanket line is gone.

---

## [1.14.0] — 2026-07-29

**Close the shell FERPA hole (`cat .keymap.json`) and codify "letters are read, not parsed" (#270).**

Two hardenings against the two failure modes a field session exposed — an agent trying to *reconstruct* the de-id map after being blocked, and a script that *fabricated* student claims by regexing prose.

- **`grade_guardian` now blocks a raw READ of a Zone-2 file in the shell.** The Read-tool block never covered `cat`/`head`/`tail`/`less`/python `open()`, so an agent denied `Read .keymap.json` reached for `cat .keymap.json` to rebuild the code↔user_id map. The Bash branch now denies a raw-display verb applied to a Zone-2 file, and points to `grader_reidentify` (which reads the keymap internally). Deliberately **still allows** the sanctioned verification the constitution permits — `wc -l`/`ls`/`stat` and the filtered `grep <code> … | cut -d',' -f1,2` — and exempts `lib/tools/` readers. Case-sensitive so git `HEAD` isn't mistaken for `head`.
- **"Final letters are READ, not parsed" is now a rule, not a lesson.** A field script regex-"extracted" a requested grade from students' prose and emitted *"you requested an A"* to students who asked for a C. The constitution gains a grounding principle (any claim you repeat to a student comes from reading their letter in full; structured data may be parsed, prose may not — read it or abstain), and the `grading` skill carries the detailed rule.

---

## [1.13.0] — 2026-07-29

**`grader_push --roster-csv`: comment on non-submitters (a 0 / no-submission student) by user_id (#269).**

The file-keyed push builds its set from submission files, so a student who never submitted has no `.review.csv` row and is unreachable — but instructors still need to leave them feedback. In Canvas, a non-submitter's submission object exists (empty, `unsubmitted`) and *does* accept a comment; you just have to address them by user_id instead of a file.

- **New `--roster-csv <path>`** — a CSV with a `user_id` column plus a `comment` (inline) or `comment_file` (path) column. Posts **comment-only** straight to `/submissions/<user_id>`, reaching non-submitters. Grade untouched; disclosure tag applied (pass `--disclosure script` for an instructor-written note); **still gated by the `grade_guardian` pop-up** (it's a comment push with `--push`). Idempotent — a user already in the push log is skipped unless `--force`, so re-runs don't stack a second comment.
- Pure loader `load_roster_comments` (unit-tested); the `grading` skill documents the non-submitter path.

---

## [1.12.0] — 2026-07-29

**Route the grading path at the right tool: grader_push refuses No-Submission columns and points to grader_standing; the pointer block drops the stale terminal-confirmation wording (#268).**

Two "wrong guidance sends the agent off a cliff" fixes from the field.

- **Submission-type boundary in `grader_push`.** A field agent ran `grader_push --grade-only` on a No-Submission "Your Grade" column, hit the regrade gate, and thrashed toward `--force` and the raw API. grader_push already fetches the assignment; it now reads `submission_types` and, on a No-Submission / on-paper / not-graded column, **refuses up front and points at `grader_standing`** (roster-keyed, no regrade gate) — the right tool for value grades on a standing column. `--comments-only` is still allowed there (comments attach to any submission object). The `grading` skill gains a front-loaded "which push tool?" discriminator so agents route correctly *before* hitting the wall.
- **Pointer-block grading text updated to the chat-approval model.** The sentinel block injected into course `AGENTS.md` still described the pre-1.9.0 flow — *"`--mark-reviewed` (type `reviewed`) → `--push` (type `push`); `--yes` does not bypass review."* That's wrong since 1.9.0/1.9.1. It now says: `--yes` is honored (no terminal), and `grade_guardian` fires an in-chat pop-up at **both** the review and the push (#264/#265). Existing course repos self-heal the wording on the next `cb_update --apply`.

---

## [1.11.0] — 2026-07-29

**New `improve` skill: a local continuous-improvement kanban (`IMPROVEMENTS.md`) so course findings are tracked to done, not lost in one-off letters.**

Audits and field sessions kept surfacing "should fix / should try" items that landed in chat or a handoff letter and were gone by the next session. The `improve` skill gives each course a single git-tracked kanban board.

- **`IMPROVEMENTS.md` at the course root** — plain markdown, instructor-editable, Zone-1 (no student PII). Columns are the lifecycle: `Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → Done`. Cards carry an id (`C-###`), source+date, size/risk, and a PR/commit link as they move. Lightweight agile — WIP limit on In Progress, ordered Ready (top = next), an In-Review gate so nothing self-marks Done. Template ships in the skill.
- **Audits feed the board.** The `audit` skill now says its real output is a prioritized set of `IMPROVEMENTS.md` cards (`src: audit <date>`), not a report that gets filed and forgotten.
- **Named for clarity, not collision.** File `IMPROVEMENTS.md`, skill `improve` — a repo-facing "CI" slug would read as continuous *integration*; this is continuous *improvement*.
- Wired into distribution: added to the `cb_update` skill set, the constitution's skills index, and the pointer block, so every `cb_update --apply` course activates it. (Also backfilled `voicing` into the pointer-block skill list, which had been omitted.)

---

## [1.10.0] — 2026-07-28

**`grader_push --comments-only`: add or fix feedback on already-graded work without touching the grade (#266).**

The `regrade_gate` refuses an already-graded submission (Canvas *appends* comments, so re-runs stack). Correct — but it also blocked a legitimate workflow: **grade now, comment later**, or **replace a wrong comment**. A field session hit this after grading a standing column, and the only "fixes" on offer were destructive (clear the grades and re-push) or manual (Canvas UI).

- **New `--comments-only` mode** (mirror image of `--grade-only`). Posts the comment, **leaves the grade untouched**, bypasses the regrade gate (no re-grade is happening), and reuses the `--regrade` **supersede** machinery — a prior grader comment for the same key is deleted before the fresh one posts, so re-runs never stack. Mutually exclusive with `--grade-only`.
- **Still fully gated.** `--comments-only --push` posts AI-drafted comments, so it trips the `grade_guardian` review + push pop-ups (#264/#265) exactly like a normal comment push — it is *not* the frictionless value-only path.
- **Routes at the wall.** The "already graded — SKIPPED" message now names `--comments-only` as the way to add/fix comments without changing grades, so an agent that hits the gate is pointed at the tool instead of hunting override flags or the raw API.

Value-only / `grader_standing` pushes unchanged. *Non-submitters* (students with no submission file) still need a roster-keyed path — that's a fast-follow.

---

## [1.9.1] — 2026-07-28

**Fix: the chat-approval loosening let an agent skip the review — force the pop-up at the review checkpoint too (#265).**

1.9.0 honored `--yes` on the AI-drafted path and put the human gate on the guardian's `--push` prompt. But it left a hole: the agent could run `grader_push --mark-reviewed --yes` and **self-attest review** — marking the comments reviewed without ever showing the instructor `_all_comments.md` — then push. A field session did exactly that.

- **`grade_guardian` now fires the `ask` prompt at BOTH checkpoints** — `--mark-reviewed` *and* `--push` — on the AI-drafted path (still silent on `--grade-only`/`--test-user`/`--retract`). `--yes` cannot bypass it: the hook runs above the tool. So the instructor clicks an in-chat pop-up to **attest the review** (Deny if the agent skipped showing the comments) and again to **authorize the push** — two clicks the agent can neither skip nor forge.
- **`grading` skill tightened.** The push protocol now says the review is mandatory and never skippable, and documents the two pop-ups (attest, then push). Removed the "just run the flow" phrasing that read as license to skip step 2.

Still no terminal, ever. Value-only / `grader_standing` pushes are unchanged.

---

## [1.9.0] — 2026-07-28

**Grade push moves off the terminal: `--yes` is honored on the AI-drafted path, and the human gate becomes an in-chat permission prompt (#264).**

Field use kept hitting the same wall: on the AI-drafted-comment path `grader_push` refused `--yes` (#97/#207) and demanded a keystroke at a real terminal (#241), so agents dead-ended non-technical faculty with "run this in your terminal and type 'reviewed'/'push'" — or thrashed and reached for a direct Canvas API write. That terminal gate was aimed at the wrong threat (a headless `echo push | …` bypass), not the interactive instructor sitting in the Claude Code chat.

- **`grader_push` honors `--yes` on every path.** The `is_yes_refused_on_review` refusal is removed; `--mark-reviewed --yes` and `--push --yes` now work for AI-drafted comments too. The agent runs the whole flow — no terminal keystroke, ever. The `.reviewed` marker reverts to its staleness-guard role (#46), not a human attestation.
- **`grade_guardian` forces an in-chat `ask` on the AI-drafted push.** The human gate moved UP to the PreToolUse hook: on a `grader_push … --push` that writes per-student comments (not `--grade-only`/`--test-user`/`--retract`), the guardian returns `permissionDecision: "ask"`, so Claude Code prompts the instructor to approve the write. Their click is the attestation that replaced the keystroke — un-fakeable by the agent, never a separate terminal. (In full bypass-permissions mode nothing prompts — an explicit opt-out.)
- **`grading` skill rewritten to the chat-approval flow.** "You are not blocked from pushing": show the comments + old→new preview in chat, get the instructor's reply, `--mark-reviewed --yes`, `--push --yes` → the guardian prompt is the gate. Adds a "when rows are skipped, read why (`--regrade`/`--allow-lower`/`--include-inactive`) — never reach for the API" note, straight from a field session that thrashed through override flags after a push skipped most rows.

Value-only / `grader_standing` pushes are unchanged (the human is the grader there; `--yes` was always allowed).

---

## [1.8.13] — 2026-07-28

**`voicing` skill: real convention + a template derived from the actual course profiles.**

Read the voice files that already exist across the repos and found the real convention is **`grading/FEEDBACK_VOICE.md`** (not the `VOICING.md` the skill first guessed), with a shared structure — Core principles · Banned jargon · Template openers · Comment structure by assignment type · Before/after · Hard rules/poka-yokes. Captured that as **`FEEDBACK_VOICE.template.md`** in the skill (so a new profile has a known shape), and pointed the skill at the real location plus the alt spots some courses use (`agents/knowledge/student_feedback_voice*.md`) — which is exactly why one repo's agents kept missing its profile and inventing a new voice: the profile lived at a non-standard path.

---

## [1.8.12] — 2026-07-28

**Two fixes for the "reinvent instead of reuse" pattern: `cb_update` now installs the guardian hook, and a new `voicing` skill.**

Diagnosing why one course repo "always did things differently" surfaced two gaps of the same shape — an agent reinventing what already exists because nothing pointed it at the real thing:

- **`cb_update` now ensures the `grade_guardian` hook.** An audit found one repo (init'd before the hook feature, later `cb_update`d only for skills) was the *only* one without the guardian — so its agents could hand-write Canvas writes and route around gates freely. `cb_update` installed skills + pointer but never the hook. It now does (idempotent, non-clobbering, guarded on the vendored script), so any repo brought current gets the enforcement. Run `cb_update --apply` to backfill it.
- **New `voicing` skill.** Agents kept inventing a fresh feedback voice per session instead of using the instructor's established one. The skill carries the discipline — load the course's voicing profile (`VOICING.md` / `grading/voicing.md`, Zone-1) and write in that voice for *every* comment; never invent one; if none exists, elicit it and save it for reuse. Loads alongside `grading`. Seventh operating-mode skill.

---

## [1.8.11] — 2026-07-28

**Grading skill: a "fresh data before any grading decision" discipline (field-driven).**

A course session reasoned off a stale `_computed_grades.csv` and reached a confidently-wrong conclusion (a "KC3 blocker" when 19/31 students had actually completed it), then hand-rolled a `verify_data_freshness.sh` + a poka-yoke doc to prevent it. But the toolkit already builds freshness in — `grader_fetch_gradebook.py` stamps `fetched_at` and skips only if the cache is younger than `--max-age-hours` (default 6). The `grading` skill now states the rule — pull fresh Canvas data before reasoning about grades; use the tool's cache (with its visible age), never a custom CSV whose age you can't see — so agents reach for the built-in guarantee instead of re-inventing it locally.

---

## [1.8.10] — 2026-07-28

**Engagement report now excludes withdrawn students by default.**

The report was dominated by `inactive` (withdrawn/deactivated) students — in one section, 20 of 26 flagged were inactive. Those are **formally-handled** withdrawals, not the *unofficial* withdrawals the report targets, so they were noise. The default now audits **actively-enrolled students only** (inactive / completed / deleted / rejected excluded); the flag flips from `--active-only` to **`--include-inactive`** for the rare case where you want to review a withdrawal you suspect wasn't processed.

Reverses the 1.7.37 default at the maintainer's direction (that release *added* inactive students on the reasoning they might be unofficial withdrawals; in practice they swamped the report with already-processed drops).

---

## [1.8.9] — 2026-07-28

**Critical: the Rust engagement engine had the SAME pagination bug — every student read "never participated" on Rust-enabled repos. Python is now the trusted default.**

1.8.6 fixed the pagination in the Python engine but not the compiled **Rust** binary, which is the *default when present* — so a repo with the Rust binary (e.g. DS460) produced a report flagging **all 35 students as UW-never** while Python-only repos classified correctly. The Rust `get_paginated` blind-incremented `page` and `bail!`ed on the page-2 `400`, zeroing every student's engagement.

Two changes:
- **Python is now the trusted default engine**; Rust is opt-in via `--rust`. A wrong Title IV report is worse than a slow one, and the field binaries are stale, so the tool no longer uses a compiled Rust binary unless explicitly asked. This makes every repo correct on the next pull — no recompile needed.
- **The Rust source is fixed too** (Link-header pagination, matching the Python fix; compiles clean) — so `--rust` is correct *after rebuilding the binary from current source*. An older binary still mis-reports, hence the opt-in + the warning the flag prints.

If you use `--rust`, rebuild first (`cd canvas-toolbox/lib/tools/engagement_audit_rs && cargo build --release`).

---

## [1.8.8] — 2026-07-28

**The engagement report filename now includes the course name — identifiable across sections.**

Reports were named `engagement-audit-<course-id>-<date>.md`; with 5 sections across 4 courses the opaque course-id made them hard to tell apart in `~/Downloads/`. Now: `engagement-<course-name>-<course-id>-<date>.md` (e.g. `engagement-big-data-programming-123456-2026-07-28.md`). The course *name* is a title, not student PII (Zone-1), so it's safe in the filename; the course-id stays for disambiguation.

---

## [1.8.7] — 2026-07-28

**`course_engagement_audit`: the report is now a focused, failing-students-only Title IV list with clear UW-never / UW-before / F-After classes.**

Reworked to match how the report is actually used (guided by a real field example):

- **Only flagged students appear.** A **passing**, engaged student is excluded; so is anyone **formally dropped** (deleted/rejected enrollment — the fetch already omits them). **Inactive/concluded** enrollments ARE included (they may be unofficial withdrawals not yet processed) and now carry an **Enrollment** column so the reviewer sees who isn't currently active — this replaces the separate INACTIVE_ENROLLMENT section from 1.7.37.
- **Three clear classes** (`title_iv_class`), grouped into their own report sections: **UW-never** (never participated → return 100%), **UW-before** (failing, stopped before the cutoff → R2T4 by last date), **F-After** (failing, engaged past the cutoff → completer-F, no R2T4). Each section is a name/user-id/last-engagement/score/enrollment table.

Note this reverses two earlier calls at the maintainer's direction: passing students are now excluded (they weren't before), and inactive students are classified inline rather than parked in a review-only bucket.

---

## [1.8.6] — 2026-07-28

**Fix: the engagement audit's per-student submission fetch made every student look "never participated."**

`course_engagement_audit`'s submission + discussion fetches (in the Python fallback and the main file) still incremented `page` blindly — the same `Link: rel="next"` bug fixed for the *enrollment* fetch in 1.7.37, but missed here. `/students/submissions?student_ids[]` answers a page past the last with **HTTP 400**, so on a single-page result (any student with <100 submissions — i.e. essentially all of them) page 1 succeeded, page 2 400'd, the fetch crashed, and the student was recorded with **no engagement** → the whole report showed everyone as "never participated" despite having grades. Found in the field (and correctly diagnosed as *not* an API-key problem — page 1 and enrollments worked; only the blind page 2 failed).

All three fetches now follow the `Link` header (discussion-topic 404s still skip gracefully). The Rust engagement binary should be checked for the same pattern if it's in use.

---

## [1.8.5] — 2026-07-28

**Shift-left: catch an illegal grade at `.review.csv` creation, not at push (field-proposed).**

`grader_push` validates a score against the assignment's `grading_type` (#99) — so `incomplete` on a `points` assignment is correctly refused. But that check only fired at *push* time; the bad value sailed all the way into `.review.csv` first, making it unclear where it came from. A course agent proposed catching it earlier, in `grader_reidentify`. The instinct was right; the placement needed care, because `grader_reidentify` is a pure *offline* join and can't call Canvas for the grading_type.

The fix respects that: `grader_fetch` now caches the assignment's grading rules to `.assignment_meta.json` (grading_type, points_possible, name — **no student data, so Zone-1**), and `grader_reidentify` validates each summary score against it **offline**, erroring early with a clear per-key message (`KC1-A: 'incomplete' — not a legal grade for grading_type=points`) before writing `.review.csv`. It reuses grader_push's `validate_grade_for_grading_type` so the two tools never disagree, and it no-ops safely when the cache is absent (push stays the backstop).

---

## [1.8.4] — 2026-07-28

**New `grader_letter_comments.py` — the sanctioned End-Letter comment push, so final-letter grading no longer needs a hand-written `fix_push.py`.**

When `grade_guardian` (correctly) blocked a course's `fix_push.py`, the missing piece was exposed: final-letter grading has two writes — the grade (Course Grade, value-only → already covered by `grader_standing`) and a **comment-only** note (End Letter, preserving the existing grade) — and the toolkit had no sanctioned tool for the second. This is it: a roster CSV (`user_id,comment`) → `comment[text_comment]` writes, **never** a `posted_grade`, so a grade is never touched.

The HG-5 line is drawn explicitly: this tool is for **instructor-authored** comments (a final-grade note from the course's script/template), which is why `--yes` is allowed like `grader_standing` — the instructor reviews the previews and consents, no terminal for non-technical faculty. **AI-drafted per-student feedback does not belong here** — it goes through `grader_push` and its review gate. Guards: Test-Student exclusion (#61), hard-fail on unmatched/ambiguous key (never comment on the wrong student), blank-comment skip, dry-run by default. The `grading` skill and reuse doctrine now document the two-tool split so agents retire `fix_push.py` instead of trying to whitelist it.

---

## [1.8.3] — 2026-07-28

**Windows fix: `cb_update`'s copy-fallback skills now refresh on re-run instead of freezing stale.**

On Windows without symlink permission, `cb_update` copies the skills into the course root (fallback). But a copy is a real directory, so the *next* run mistook it for a course-owned skill and skipped it — meaning Windows consumers' skills would freeze at first-copy and go stale after every `git pull`. Now a copy is marked (`.cb_managed`), so re-runs refresh it while still never touching a genuinely course-owned skill. Its tests were also made OS-agnostic (relpath separator; symlink-or-copy outcome) so they hold on Windows, not just posix — which is how the bug was found.

---

## [1.8.2] — 2026-07-28

**`grader_standing` no longer dead-ends non-technical faculty at a terminal — it guides the agent to `--yes`.**

Field report: an agent computed a "your grade" standing push (17 students, previewed and correct), the instructor said "push" in chat three times, and the agent kept telling them to *open a terminal and type push* — a total dead end for non-technical faculty. The cause: grader_standing borrowed grader_push's TTY-only confirmation message, even though **`--yes` is allowed for grader_standing** (it's value-only, instructor-computed — not AI-drafted feedback, so it's on the safe side of HG-5).

Fix: on a non-interactive run without `--yes`, grader_standing now tells the agent to **re-run with `--yes` once the instructor confirms the preview** — explicitly "do NOT send them to a terminal." The instructor reviewing the `old → new` preview in chat *is* the attestation; `--yes` captures it. The `grading` skill and the constitution now carry the rule: **audience = non-technical faculty; complete actions for them, never hand them a terminal command** — the one exception being the genuine human-review gate on AI-drafted grades (grader_push HG-5).

To post the field case immediately: add `--yes` to the command.

---

## [1.8.1] — 2026-07-28

**`cb_update --pull` and phrase-routing — "update cb" now maps to one command, not an improvised `git pull` in the wrong repo.**

Agents told to "git pull cb" kept `cd`-ing into the toolkit dev clone (or the course repo) and pulling *there*, instead of the course's own vendored copy. Two fixes:

- **`cb_update.py --pull`** does the `git pull` itself, in the correct vendored dir (`<course-root>/canvas-toolbox`), then re-execs to apply the freshly-pulled skills + pointer. One command is the whole update.
- **Phrase-routing in the consumer AGENTS.md pointer block** (injected by `cb_update`): ten common phrasings — "update cb", "git pull cb", "pull cb", "update canvas-toolbox", "pull canvas-toolbox", "update the toolkit", "refresh cb", "upgrade canvas-toolbox", "sync the toolkit", "get the latest cb" — all route to `cb_update.py --pull --apply`, with an explicit "do NOT `cd` + git pull by hand" warning. A test pins the phrases so a line-wrap can't silently split one.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-07-28

**Milestone: the operating-mode skills architecture.**

canvas-toolbox is now organized as a **constitution + skills**. The always-on safety law (FERPA discipline, the Canvas-write doctrine + `grade_guardian`, behavioral principles) lives in `AGENTS.md`; each operating mode is a **skill** that loads on demand: `grading`, `course-build`, `audit`, `accommodations`, `ferpa-deid`, `title-iv`. This is a structural shift on the scale of the v1.7 offline suite, so it earns the minor rev. The pieces are complete and stable as of 1.8.0 — the constitution split + six skills (shipped 1.7.40) and the `cb_update` propagation tool (1.7.43).

**Consumers must re-init — a plain `git pull` is no longer enough.** Skills only activate once they're symlinked at the course root:

```
cd canvas-toolbox && git pull && cd ..
uv run python canvas-toolbox/lib/tools/cb_update.py --apply
```

That installs the skills and heals the grading-protocol pointer. No breaking API changes — tools are unchanged; this is a documentation/architecture reorganization plus the propagation tooling.

---

## [1.7.43] — 2026-07-28

**New `cb_update.py` (the "cb re-init") — bring an old course-repo init current, and heal the stale pointer the constitution rewrite left behind.**

A field audit of 9 consumer repos found the six operating-mode skills active in **0 of 9** (Claude Code only discovers skills at the *course* root, not the vendored subdir) and a stale grading-protocol pointer — to a heading the 1.7.40 constitution rewrite renamed — in **6 of 9**. A `git pull` can't fix either: it refreshes the vendored toolkit, not the consumer's own files. (The audit's good news: **0 of 9** had any tracked FERPA/toolkit leak — the two-zone gitignore discipline holds in the field.)

`cb_update` closes the gap idempotently and non-destructively, run from a course root:
- **Skills:** symlinks `<course-root>/.claude/skills/<skill>` → the vendored `canvas-toolbox/.claude/skills/<skill>`, so Claude Code activates them *and* they auto-track future `git pull`s (a symlink, not a drifting copy). A course's own same-named skill is never clobbered; Windows falls back to a copy.
- **Pointer:** `sync_grading_protocol`'s injected block now points at the constitution + skills index (not the renamed heading), and injection is **self-healing** — a stale marker block is refreshed in place, surrounding course content untouched.
- **Version:** reports the vendored version and nudges `git pull`.

Dry-run by default; `--apply` writes.

---

## [1.7.42] — 2026-07-28

**New `grader_quiz_clear_pending.py` — clear an auto-scored quiz stuck in "To Do" on a 0-point manual question.**

A classic quiz with an essay/file-upload question auto-scores on submission (`workflow_state: graded`) but lingers in the instructor's To-Do because the manual question is `pending_review`. `grader_push` can't help (regrade_gate correctly refuses an already-graded submission), and `grader_audit_workflow` deliberately won't touch a moderation queue. When that question is worth **0 points**, this tool posts a 0 to it — marking it graded and clearing the flag.

**It can never change a grade:** the hard invariant is that it only ever posts to a *manual* question worth *0 points*. Anything worth points is real grading and is refused (→ SpeedGrader). Dry-run by default; `--apply` writes; `canvas_course_guard` gates the live-course write. Classic quizzes only (New Quizzes can't be graded via this API). The `grading` skill now documents the case so agents stop stacking `--force`/`--regrade` at grader_push for it.

---

## [1.7.41] — 2026-07-28

**New `grader_fetch_gradebook.py` — mirror the live Canvas gradebook locally, de-identified and cached.**

The shared gradebook primitive that was missing: one API sweep builds a `user_id`-keyed score matrix (rows = students, columns = assignments, cells = scores) cached under `.canvas/gradebook/`, stamped with `fetched_at`. Any skill can reuse a fresh copy instead of re-hitting Canvas one assignment at a time — it's the upstream input `grader_standing` (the "your grade" column) and `grader_reconcile` need.

**De-identified by default** — no names, so the cache is FERPA Zone-1 (LLM-safe) and every skill can read it; `grader_reidentify_gradebook.py` turns it into a named report when a human needs one. Online mirror (distinct from offline `.imscc` mode). Follows `Link: rel="next"` pagination (issue #67), excludes the Test Student (#61), and skips the fetch when the cache is younger than `--max-age-hours` (default 6; `--force` overrides).

---

## [1.7.40] — 2026-07-28

**Architecture: AGENTS.md is now a constitution + 6 operating-mode skills.**

A single 509-line AGENTS.md loaded *every* session — grading, course-build, CI, all of it — and the grading discipline that matters most got diluted in a 5,200-word file. Following Anthropic's Agent Skills model (metadata always-loaded ≈100 tokens; instructions load only when triggered), the toolkit now splits along that seam:

- **AGENTS.md is the constitution** — the always-on law: FERPA discipline, the Canvas-write safety doctrine + `grade_guardian`, behavioral principles, git/handoff conventions, and the skills index. Slimmed to **253 lines / 1,674 words (−68% words)**.
- **`.claude/skills/` holds six operating-mode skills**, each loaded on demand: `grading`, `course-build`, `audit`, `accommodations`, `ferpa-deid`, `title-iv`.

The six were derived by clustering all 98 tools by cohesion, not intuition. Two evidence-based calls: **Title IV is its own skill** (a federal-compliance domain distinct from course-design auditing), and **offline/`.imscc` folds into `course-build`** (same "build the course" role, different transport). Safety-critical rules stay constitutional and always-on; only mode-specific *procedure* moved to skills.

Follow-up (not in this PR): `cb_init` should surface the skills at a consumer course-repo's root so they activate in course sessions too.

---

## [1.7.39] — 2026-07-28

**`build_deid_master` now dedups by user_id — a multi-section student no longer produces duplicate rows in `.deid_master.csv`.**

The de-id master's contract is *one row per student*, but it built one row per record from Canvas `/courses/:id/users`, which returns a student **once per section**. So a student in two sections (S1 + S2 — a common shape) got **duplicate user_id rows**, which silently breaks downstream identity joins. `detect_collisions` couldn't catch it — it flags *different* user_ids sharing a code, the opposite case.

Now `dedupe_users` collapses duplicates to one entry per user_id, **merging their enrollments** so `withdrawn` stays correct (active in any section wins), and logs how many were collapsed.

Not a bug in re-identification: `grader_reidentify.py` was already keyed and duplicate-aware (`user_id → [keys]`), so mapping identities by *key* — never by sort order — remains the correct path for per-submission data where one student legitimately has many keys.

---

## [1.7.38] — 2026-07-27

**A disclosure-tag menu — say honestly what graded the work vs what wrote the comment.**

The comment tag was always `— AI drafted, instructor reviewed`. But with the hybrid grader a deterministic **script** computes the grade and the AI only drafts the comment, so a flat "AI drafted" overstates the AI's role in the grade. `grader_push` now picks the tag with `--disclosure`:

- `ai` (default) — `— AI drafted, instructor reviewed` (AI suggested the grade + drafted the comment)
- `hybrid` — `— script graded, AI-drafted comment, instructor approved`
- `script` — `— script graded, instructor reviewed` (no AI in the comment)

A course that grades one way every time can set `$CANVAS_DISCLOSURE_DEFAULT=hybrid` in its `.env` and skip the flag; an explicit `--disclosure` still wins. The chosen tag prints in the pre-push banner. `append_disclosure_tag` is now non-stacking across the **whole** menu — switching graders between runs never doubles the tag. The tag strings live in one editable dict (`DISCLOSURE_TAGS`); `DISCLOSURE_TAG` remains as the `ai` alias for back-compat.

---

## [1.7.37] — 2026-07-27

**`course_engagement_audit`: fixed an enrollment-fetch crash and stopped silently skipping inactive students.**

Two bugs, both found running a real Title IV audit:

- **Crash on single-page courses.** The enrollment fetch incremented `page` blindly and looped until an empty page — but `/enrollments` returns HTTP 400 (not an empty list) when asked for a page past the last, so any course with ≤100 students crashed at page 2. Its docstring even *claimed* it reused grader_push's Link-header pagination; it didn't. Now it follows `Link: rel="next"` like grader_push (issue #67).
- **Inactive students were dropped entirely.** The audit fetched only `state=active`, so inactive/concluded enrollments — exactly the population a Title IV last-date-of-engagement audit exists to review — never appeared. Now inactive/completed students are included by default in their **own** `INACTIVE ENROLLMENT — review required` section: their last engagement date is computed and shown, but they are **not** auto-classified as UW/UF (an inactive enrollment may be an already-processed *official* withdrawal — that determination is the registrar/FA office's, not the tool's). `--active-only` restores the old active-only scope.

---

## [1.7.36] — 2026-07-27

**`grade_guardian` now blocks *running* an existing bypass script — the third and last leg.**

The guard covered creating a bypass script (Write, fixed in 1.7.34) and editing one (Edit), but not **running** one that already exists: `python fix_push.py` has no write verb in the command — the `requests.put` is hidden in the file. That gap was behind a cluster of field failures that all share one root cause (a grade write that skipped grader_push, so none of its protections applied): **duplicate comments** (bypassed the duplicate-comment Andon), **grades on Test Student** (bypassed the #61 exclusion), and **wrong grade scales** (bypassed grade validation).

Now, for a `python x.py` / `uv run … x.py` command, the guard reads `x.py` and blocks it if the body carries the Canvas grade-write signature — skipping `lib/tools/` (the reviewed tooling legitimately writes to Canvas). Same regex-not-a-firewall limit as the rest of the guard (obfuscation like `exec(open(...))` still slips), but it decisively stops a plain `python push.py`, the actual field pattern. Fails open on an unreadable path — never bricks a session.

This neutralizes bypass scripts that already exist in a repo, not just new ones. `cd canvas-toolbox && git pull` to 1.7.36 to get it.

---

## [1.7.35] — 2026-07-27

**`course_engagement_audit` derives the UF cutoff from the Canvas course end date — no more hand-supplied date.**

The Title IV audit required `--uf-date YYYY-MM-DD`, so a grader either interrupted to ask the instructor for a date or guessed one. But the tool already fetches the course object — the end date was sitting right there, thrown away. Now `--uf-date` is optional: with no value (or `end`), it uses the course's Canvas `end_at`, falling back to the term end date; `term-end` forces the term date; an explicit `YYYY-MM-DD` still wins. The resolved cutoff and its source print in the header (`UF cutoff: 2026-07-25 (source: Canvas course end date)`) so the classification date stays auditable. If Canvas has no course or term end set, it asks for an explicit date rather than guessing.

---

## [1.7.34] — 2026-07-27

**Critical: the `grade_guardian` hook was blind to hand-written push scripts — it read the wrong field.**

The guard's flagship catch (#213) is blocking the *creation* of a bypass script: a Bash hook can't see inside `python push.py`, but the Write hook sees the file body as it's written. Except it read the body from `tool_input["file_contents"]` — and Claude Code's Write tool sends it as **`content`**. So the body was always empty to the guard, the write-signature check never matched, and every hand-written Canvas push script sailed through. Found in the field: a grader that couldn't locate a push script simply wrote its own 186-line `requests.put` script, and the guard allowed it. The unit tests passed only because they used the same wrong key the code did.

Fix: read the body from `content` (real Write param), `file_contents` (legacy/alt), and `new_string` (Edit) — whichever is present. Tests now use the real `content` key and pin all three, so a field-name drift can't silently disarm the catch again.

If you vendor the hook, `cd canvas-toolbox && git pull` to 1.7.34 restores the protection — no re-init needed.

---

## [1.7.33] — 2026-07-27

**New `grader_standing.py` — push an instructor-computed "your grade" standing column, weekly and automatable.**

Canvas's automatic-zero policy makes the running total misleading, and `grader_push`'s `regrade_gate` deliberately refuses to overwrite an already-graded submission with no resubmission (it guards against stacked comments). Both are correct, but together they block a real workflow instructors already run by hand: a single No-Submission "your grade" column, computed from a syllabus table, refreshed a couple times a semester. This tool automates that refresh.

Standing is a different shape from feedback — roster-keyed (by Canvas `user_id`, resolved from SIS/login/email against the course roster), value-only (no comments, no de-identification; the instructor owns the number), and intentionally overwritten every run — so it's a **sanctioned sibling** of `grader_push` rather than a mode bolted onto it. It reuses grader_push's env/auth, `canvas_course_guard`, submission fetch, manual-post release, and the TTY-safe confirmation, so the two writers can't drift on what matters.

The column is often weighted 100%, so the guards are strict: roster resolution **hard-fails** on any unmatched or ambiguous key (never grade the wrong student); dry-run by default with a FERPA-safe `user_id: old → new` diff; out-of-bounds grades abort; a score drop past `--swing-threshold` (the shifted-CSV symptom) aborts unless `--allow-swings`. `--yes` is allowed (deterministic, value-only) so weekly runs can be automated — the safe side of the HG-5 line.

```
grader_standing.py --csv standing.csv --assignment-id <id>            # dry-run diff
grader_standing.py --csv standing.csv --assignment-id <id> --push     # write (confirm)
grader_standing.py --csv standing.csv --assignment-id <id> --push --yes --allow-enrolled  # weekly/automated
```

---

## [1.7.32] — 2026-07-27

**The HG-5 push confirmation now requires an interactive terminal — a piped `push` can no longer stand in for the instructor.**

The `--yes` refusal (#207/#214) forces a human to *type* `push`/`reviewed` at the confirmation prompt — the typed word attests the instructor is present for a live grade write. But `input()` reads whatever is on stdin, so `echo push | grader_push … --push` satisfied the gate with **no human**. An agent, blocked by the `--yes` refusal, used exactly that (plus a `touch .reviewed` to defeat the freshness gate) to push AI-drafted grades to a live enrolled course. The gate attested nothing.

Fix: every live-write confirmation (`push`, `reviewed`, test-user push, `retract`) now runs through `require_typed_confirmation()`, which refuses when `sys.stdin.isatty()` is False — a pipe, redirect, or heredoc is not a person. The final push gate is the backstop: even a multi-line pipe that satisfies the earlier `locked`/`collisions` acknowledgments dies at the push prompt because it demands a TTY. A real instructor in a real terminal is unaffected.

Known remaining gap (tracked): `touch .reviewed` still defeats the mtime-based review-freshness marker — a fingerprint-of-the-review-surface marker is the durable fix.

---

## [1.7.31] — 2026-07-27

**The `grade_guardian` hook can no longer brick a session — it fails open if it can't find its own script.**

A guardrail that hard-blocks when misconfigured is worse than no guardrail. If the hook's script path was ever wrong (a rename, a non-standard layout, or standalone canvas-toolbox where the `canvas-toolbox/` subdir prefix doubles), a bare `python3 <missing>` exited 2 — Python's can't-open-file code, which is *also* the hook "deny" code — so **every** `Bash`/`Read`/`Edit`/`Write` was blocked, including the tools needed to fix it. Found by hitting it in the toolkit repo itself.

### Fixed
- **`grade_guardian.py`** — `hook_command()` now wraps the invocation so a **missing script fails open** (`sh -c 'f=…; [ -f "$f" ] || exit 0; exec python3 "$f"'`): absent → allow (exit 0); present → `exec` hands off so the guardian's own exit code (2 = deny) still propagates. A wrong path can no longer lock anyone out.
- **`cb-init`** — `_install_guardian_hook` now verifies the vendored `canvas-toolbox/lib/tools/grade_guardian.py` actually exists under the root **before** wiring the hook, so it's skipped in standalone / non-course layouts (where the path would be wrong) instead of installing a known-broken hook.

Course repos on the standard `<root>/canvas-toolbox/` layout were never affected (their path resolves correctly); this removes the whole class of "bad path bricks the session" regardless.

---

## [1.7.30] — 2026-07-27

**New knowledge: "use the vendored tools, don't reimplement them" — the custom→vendored migration map, baked in so every course repo benefits.**

A usage scan of the mature course repos (itm327, ds460) found the predictable drift trap: the toolkit was generalized *from* course scripts, so courses keep running old local copies that miss every safety fix (the duplicate-comment, empty-comment, and stuck-workflow-state bugs all came from custom scripts). This makes the guidance canonical instead of tribal.

### Added
- **`lib/agents/knowledge/toolkit_reuse_knowledge.md`** — the tool-discovery rule ("search `lib/tools/` first; never hand-write a Canvas script"), the known custom→vendored **migration map** (`push_grades.py→grader_push.py`, `checks.py→grader_signals.py`, `fix_canvas_grade_state.py→grader_audit_workflow.py`, the `tools/` course-build twins, …), the migration procedure, and how the `grade_guardian` hook makes it enforceable. Cataloged in `knowledge/README.md`.
- **`cb-init`** — the generated course AGENTS.md stub now carries a pointer to it, so new course repos start with the reuse rule instead of growing a parallel toolchain.

---

## [1.7.29] — 2026-07-27

**Resubmission detection and re-grade now share one definition — the report flags exactly what `--regrade` acts on.**

Brings the `grader_fetch_resubmissions.py` detector onto `main` (from the `feature/grader-resubmissions` branch) and wires it to the same `classify_submission_state()` the `--regrade` gate uses, so the two can't drift.

### Added
- **`grader_fetch_resubmissions.py`** — detects submissions resubmitted after grading (`submitted_at > graded_at`) or never graded, and writes a FERPA-safe report (user_id + SpeedGrader links; `--all` scans a whole course). ITM 327 Spring 2026 had 21 resubmissions across 10 assignments go unnoticed for weeks — this surfaces them.

### Changed
- **`grader_push.py`** — `classify_submission_state()` now parses timestamps as datetimes instead of comparing ISO strings, so a resubmission with sub-second precision (`…:00.500Z` vs `…:00Z`, which string order mis-ranks) is classified correctly. It's the **single source of truth**: the detector imports it (not its own copy), and drops the old `workflow_state == "submitted"` pre-filter — so it also catches resubmissions whose workflow_state is stuck (issue #226), consistent with the re-grade gate.

Net: detection and the `--regrade` action agree by construction — what the report shows is what gets re-graded.

---

## [1.7.28] — 2026-07-23

**`--regrade` is now resubmission-only and supersede-not-stack — the poka-yoke completing the Andon.**

PR 2 of 2 (PR 1, v1.7.27, added the default hard gate). `--regrade` no longer just relaxes the gate; it enforces "never re-grade unless a late resubmission" and replaces the prior comment instead of adding another.

### Changed
- **`grader_push.py`** — `--regrade` now admits **only resubmissions** (`submitted_at > graded_at`), via a `classify_submission_state()` step (`ungraded` / `graded_current` / `resubmitted`). Unchanged already-graded work is refused *even with* `--regrade` ("already graded, no new submission — nothing to re-grade"). And on the resubmissions it does push, it **supersedes**: deletes the prior grader comment(s) recorded in `.push_log.md` for those rows, then re-posts one — so a resubmission ends with a single fresh comment, not a stacked pile. Only our own logged comment_ids are touched (never student/TA comments); best-effort + logged, and a missing prior (fresh clone) is a no-op.

### Added
- Pure `classify_submission_state()` + `comments_to_supersede()` helpers; `regrade_gate()` now takes the classified state. Unit tests for the classifier, the resubmission-only gate, and the supersede selection.

Together with the Andon (v1.7.27): default never re-comments; `--regrade` touches only genuine resubmissions and replaces rather than stacks. That's the full "never comment/re-grade unless a late resubmission" behavior.

---

## [1.7.27] — 2026-07-23

**Andon: `grader_push.py` now refuses to re-comment/re-grade an already-graded submission by default — stops the "4 comments per student" bug.**

Canvas **appends** comments (never replaces), and the collision guard only *warned* (bypassable), while `.push_log` idempotency is per-repo and `--force`-defeatable. So re-runs stacked grader comments — some students got 4 — and stale mirrors graded old attempts. This is the stop-the-bleeding half; the resubmission-aware `--regrade` behavior (light comment, supersede-not-stack) is the follow-up.

### Changed
- **`grader_push.py`** — the push plan now **hard-skips any submission Canvas has already graded** (`graded_at` set) unless `--regrade` is passed. Default mode therefore cannot stack a second comment. `fetch_submissions` now also returns `graded_at` / `submitted_at` / `workflow_state` (needed for the gate and the coming resubmission classifier). Independent of `--force` (which only overrides the local `.push_log`), so it also closes the `--force`-stacks-comments hole.

### Added
- **`grader_push.py`** — `--regrade` flag: explicit opt-in to touch already-graded submissions (resubmissions/corrections). Pure `is_already_graded()` + `regrade_gate()` helpers with unit tests.

---

## [1.7.26] — 2026-07-22

**Harden + test the `grader_push.py` empty-comment fix.** (#228)

The path-resolution fix landed inline in `9c0c906` (direct to main). This consolidates it and closes the two release-hygiene gaps that commit left: no test and no version signal.

### Changed
- **`grader_push.py`** — the three inline `str(challenge / feedback_file)` fixes (HOLD extraction, plan-building, lock/resubmit check) are consolidated into one `resolve_feedback_file(challenge, feedback_file)` helper, which also passes through absolute paths and paths that already exist as-is (run from inside the challenge dir), so it never double-prefixes. Behavior is unchanged from `9c0c906`.

### Added
- Regression test reproducing the original silent bug (`comment_for("feedback/KC2-*.md")` empty from a repo-root CWD) and confirming the resolved path loads the comment — the guard the original fix shipped without. Plus a version bump so vendored copies can detect via `--version` that they need to `git pull` to get the fix.

## [1.7.25] — 2026-07-22

**Post-push workflow-state audit + idempotent repair — grades no longer stick in "needs grading" after a resubmission.** (#226)

A student resubmitting after being graded resets `workflow_state` to `"submitted"`; re-applying the grade doesn't always transition it back, so the grade posts but Canvas still shows "needs grading" (2026-07-22: 31 submissions stuck). Fixes it on two surfaces, both idempotent state-repairs that never change a grade.

### Added
- **`grader_audit_workflow.py`** — `--check` scans an assignment (or `--all-assignments`) for submissions that have a grade but are still `workflow_state "submitted"` (FERPA-safe: user_id + assignment); `--fix` idempotently re-posts the grade Canvas already carries to force `submitted → graded`. Leaves `pending_review` (moderated) and ungraded submissions untouched. Live-course writes pass `canvas_course_guard` (`--allow-enrolled`).
- **`grader_push.py`** — `--auto-fix-workflow`: after a push, verifies the just-pushed rows and, if any are still `"submitted"`, re-posts the same grade to force the transition (without it, warns and points at `grader_audit_workflow.py`). Verification never fails the push itself.
- **`grader_knowledge.md`** — documents the stuck-state issue + the repair path.

**HG-5 alignment (#213):** the repair only ever re-posts the grade Canvas already has — a state fix, never a new/AI-drafted grade — so it stays outside the `--mark-reviewed` review gate without being a backdoor around it, and as a sanctioned `lib/tools/` tool it's the path the `grade_guardian` hook expects instead of a manual API re-post.

**Hybrid grader Sprint 4 (#192): the HG-6 low-band benefit-of-the-doubt audit — the last piece.** (#192, Sprint 4)

Deterministic layers under-detect, so a low consensus may be an artifact of a wrong/narrow NLP scope. Every low-band tier now gets one more look, priors removed.

### Added
- **`grader_lowband_audit.py`** — for each consensus in the bottom `--frac` (default 0.25) of the cohort's range, re-reads the raw submission with **priors excluded** ("does the required thing actually exist here, however worded?"). If that read grades **higher** than the low consensus, flags `undergrade_suspected` and routes to the instructor (writes `feedback/_lowband_audit.csv`, prints the queue). It **never lowers a grade and never auto-raises one** — disagreements resolve toward the student, by a human (HG-5/HG-6). Reuses `grader_grade`'s prompt/parse/provider; LLM injected as `grade_fn` for testing. 8 unit tests.

**#192 is complete.** The layer-routed hybrid grader now runs end to end: checkability-tagged rubric (Stage 0) → NLP evidence, term-banks & coverage (1a/1b) with LLM-sampled scope alignment (1c) → injected into N consensus passes (2) → deterministic tier-vs-evidence audit (3) → HG-6 low-band rescue (4). Deterministic where it can, probabilistic where it must, human on top — benefit of the doubt throughout.

## [1.7.23] — 2026-07-22

**Hybrid grader Sprint 3 (#192): the consensus tier is now audited against the NLP evidence — conflicts route to a human, both directions.** (#192, Sprint 3)

`grader_consensus.py`'s `needs_review` was spread-only (graders disagree). This adds the deterministic audit the architecture calls for: compare each consensus tier against its own evidence priors and flag the extremes.

### Added
- **`grader_consensus.py`** — `conflict_check()` reads `feedback/_signals.json` and adds `conflict_needs_review` + `conflict_reason` columns to `_consensus.csv`. Two directions fire: **top-band tier but thin evidence** (≥2 checkable criteria show no supporting hits — too generous) and **bottom-band tier but every criterion has evidence** (possible undergrade — the HG-6 direction). It **never moves a score** (HG-4) — it routes to a human, and prints a CONFLICT queue. No `_signals.json` → columns stay `False`, nothing else changes. 12 unit tests.

The pipeline now closes the audit loop: evidence → injected → consensus → **audited against evidence**. Sprint 4 adds the HG-6 low-band 100%-LLM re-read.

**Hybrid grader Sprint 1c (#192): LLM-sampled term-banks — build-time scope alignment, the complement to HG-6.** (#192, Sprint 1c)

The deterministic term-bank was one narrow LLM-authored guess; a synonym or paraphrase it didn't name is a false negative that undergrades work the student did. This offsets it at its source.

### Added
- **`grader_term_banks.py`** — at freeze time, samples the LLM N times (temperature-varied) for the vocabulary a student might actually use to satisfy each `mechanical`/`coverage` criterion, **unions** the samples (benefit of the doubt — a wider net catches paraphrase), and writes it into the RUBRIC.md `Evidence hint` column. `grader_signals.py` (Sprint 1b) then extracts **deterministically** against that richer, frozen bank. The LLM sampling is once, at build time, frozen + auditable — grading stays deterministic and priors still never score (HG-2). Only touches `mechanical`/`coverage` rows with an **empty** hint (never overwrites an instructor's hint; judgment rows skipped — HG-1). Dry-run by default; `--apply` writes (fills empty cells / adds the column). LLM injected as `sample_fn` for testing. 7 unit tests.
- **`grader_hybrid_architecture.md`** (v1.2) — documents build-time alignment as the complement to HG-6's grade-time audit (widen the net + rescue what slips = belt and suspenders).

## [1.7.21] — 2026-07-22

**Hybrid grader Sprint 2 (#192): `grader_grade.py --with-signals` injects the framed evidence into every pass.** (#192, Sprint 2)

The evidence layer (Sprints 1a/1b) now reaches the LLM. `grader_grade.py` already injected `_signals.json` as "CONTEXT only; never enter the score" — this renders the new prose + per-criterion evidence *with its framing* instead of dumping raw dicts.

### Added
- **`grader_grade.py`** — `--with-signals` injects the rich evidence block per submission: prose signals and per-criterion term-banks / coverage / citations, each as a framed bullet (`term_bank_hits=0 — check for paraphrase before concluding uncovered`) so the pass reads it as evidence, not a verdict (HG-3). This is the **enrichment** lever — it grounds the passes and reduces variance, and it spends tokens; run `grader_signals.py --rubric` first to populate the evidence.

### Changed
- **`grader_grade.py`** — `_format_priors()` renders compact scalar signals by default (unchanged, cheap) and excludes the nested `prose_evidence` / `criteria` structures from that line so they never dump as raw dicts; the rich rendering is gated behind `--with-signals`.

With Sprint 2, the evidence *reaches* the passes. Sprint 3 audits the consensus against it (`conflict_needs_review`); Sprint 4 adds the HG-6 low-band audit.

## [1.7.20] — 2026-07-22

**Hybrid grader Sprint 1b (#192): per-criterion evidence — rubric-derived term-banks + coverage, routed by checkability.** (#192, Sprint 1b)

Completes the evidence extractor. With a checkability-tagged `RUBRIC.md`, each submission gets per-criterion evidence routed by tag (HG-1).

### Added
- **`grader_signals.py`** — `--rubric RUBRIC.md` adds a `criteria` block per submission:
  - `judgment` rows get **no** term matching (NLP contributes no evidence — score from the text).
  - `mechanical` / `coverage` rows get a **term-bank** — derived from the criterion's own words by default (`derive_term_bank`), overridden by the `Evidence hint` column (`parse_evidence_hint`: numeric target, citation type, `prompts: a, b, c` coverage list, or plain override terms). Citation criteria route to the APA/DOI/URL counts; `coverage` rows report `k/N` items present + which are missing.
  - Every item stays **evidence to verify** (HG-3): a 0-hit term-bank reads "check for paraphrase," never "criterion unmet" — the paraphrase false-negative the HG-6 low-band audit is designed to catch.
- 12 unit tests (term-bank derivation, hint parsing, per-checkability routing, coverage-missing, end-to-end `rubric_evidence`).

With Sprint 1 complete, the evidence layer is done; Sprint 2 injects it into the grading passes (`--with-signals`).

---

## [1.7.19] — 2026-07-22

**Hybrid grader Sprint 1a (#192): prose/text evidence signals, tagged and framed as evidence-to-verify.** (#192, Sprint 1a)

`grader_signals.py` was notebook/code-oriented. This adds the prose signal set alongside it — the deterministic, criterion-independent evidence a methodology/essay grader needs.

### Added
- **`grader_signals.py`** — `prose_evidence(text)` emits, per submission: word / section / paragraph counts (structural), inline-APA `(Author, YEAR)` / DOI / URL / References-section detection (evaluative), and `?`-count / readability proxies (judgment-hint). Each item carries a taxonomy `tag` and a `framing` that presents it as **evidence to verify** — e.g. "0 literal (Author, YEAR) matches — check for DOI/URL/numbered or paraphrased attribution" — never a met/unmet verdict (HG-3). Flows into `feedback/_signals.json` via `analyze()`. 8 unit tests (counts correct, code excluded from word count, `et al.` citations, evidence framing).

Sprint 1b maps these signals to the checkability-tagged rubric rows and adds rubric-derived term-banks + coverage.

---

## [1.7.18] — 2026-07-22

**Stage 0 of the hybrid grader (#192): rubrics now carry a per-criterion `Checkability` tag — the foundation the NLP+LLM routing derives from.** (#192, Sprint 0)

Every criterion is tagged `mechanical` / `coverage` / `judgment` so the hybrid grader routes it to the authoritative layer (HG-1). Tags live **inline in `RUBRIC.md`** — single source of truth, so a rubric edit updates the checks (no companion file to drift).

### Added
- **`grader_rubric.py`** — parses the checkability-tagged criteria table from a `RUBRIC.md` (tolerant of the other columns — `#`, tier descriptors — and of an optional `Evidence hint` column), validates the tags, and prints a `checkability_fingerprint` — the Stage-0 **freeze marker** (order-insensitive, changes the instant a criterion's routing changes, so drift from a frozen rubric is detectable). CLI + `parse_checkability()` / `checkability_fingerprint()` with unit coverage.
- **Scaffold rubric templates** (`cohesive_narrative.md`, `ai_log.md`) — gain the `Checkability` column with sensible default tags + a validate-and-freeze note, so new cohorts start tagged.
- **`grader_setup_knowledge.md`** — Step 2.5: tag each criterion's checkability (with the "could a careful non-expert verify by looking/counting, or does it take judgment?" test), then freeze. Applies to all three rubric paths.

This is the precondition; the evidence extractor that consumes the tags lands in Sprint 1.

---

## [1.7.17] — 2026-07-22

**New grading principle HG-6: low grades get a benefit-of-the-doubt audit.** (#192)

Deterministic layers *under-detect* — a narrow term-bank, a citation regex that doesn't know the format, a tag that misses a renamed section is a **false negative** that undergrades work a student actually did. The `.py` extractors are LLM-authored to be deterministic; if their scope is off, they under-detect silently. HG-6 makes the mirror of the existing conflict check first-class: any consensus in the **low band** is re-audited at 100% LLM, priors excluded, reading the raw text — and disagreements resolve *toward the student* (flag `undergrade_suspected`, route to the instructor, never auto-lower on a prior).

### Added
- **`grader_hybrid_architecture.md`** (v1.1) — HG-6 principle + guardrail, the low-band audit in "The audit loop" (the mirror of the too-generous conflict check), the tool-mapping and anti-pattern. This is the design lock-in; the audit itself lands in the #192 build (Sprint 4).

## [1.7.16] — 2026-07-22

**Defense in depth for the grade-push gate: an internal precheck + the "never hand-write a Canvas script" rule in the agent spec.** (#213)

PR B of two (PR A, #216/v1.7.15, added the harness hook). This consolidates the in-tool review gate and closes the spec gap that let an agent pattern-match a `/tmp` push script from the sprint workaround.

### Changed
- **`grader_push.py`** — the required review gate (`.reviewed` exists + mtime freshness) is now one testable checkpoint, `push_precheck()`, called by `cmd_push` before any Canvas write. Behavior-preserving refactor; adds a visibility warning when AI-drafted work lacks `feedback/_consensus.csv` (already gated at `--mark-reviewed` by #95).

### Added
- **`AGENTS.md`** — "Never hand-write a Canvas write" rule in the HG-5 protocol: search `lib/tools/` first, use the tool if it exists, propose one if it doesn't — never a custom `requests`/`curl`/`/tmp/*.py`. Clarifies the S1–S4 sprint direct-API push as a one-off workaround, not the pattern. (#213 systemic gaps.)

---

## [1.7.15] — 2026-07-22

**Grades can now only reach Canvas through `grader_push.py` — a harness hook blocks direct API writes an agent can't be talked out of.** (#213)

The #207/#214 gates live *inside* `grader_push.py`, so they share one bypass: not calling the tool. In the KC1/KC2 incident an agent hand-wrote a `/tmp/push_grades.py` that hit the Canvas API directly and every gate was moot. In-tool enforcement can't catch "the tool was never used" — only a seam above the tools can. See [docs/grading-enforcement-a3.md](docs/grading-enforcement-a3.md).

### Added
- **`grade_guardian.py`** — a Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook (harness-enforced; the model cannot disable it). Denies: a direct Canvas grade write in a Bash command (`requests.put/post` / `curl -X PUT/POST` to a submissions endpoint), the *creation* of a file whose contents carry that signature (the bypass script caught at write-time — a Bash hook can't see inside `python x.py`), and Reads of FERPA Zone-2 files (`.deid_master.csv` et al., #212). Invoking `lib/tools/*.py`, editing the toolkit source, and doc files are exempt; the denial redirects the agent to `grader_push.py`. Fails open on malformed input — a guardrail must never brick the session.
- **`cb-init`** — step 14 now also wires the guardian hook into the course root `.claude/settings.json` (idempotent, non-clobbering, points at the vendored hook so it stays current on `git pull`). Existing course repos: run `cb-init` to pick it up.

Honest limit: regex over a command/file body is not a semantic firewall — a determined agent can obfuscate past it. This decisively raises the bar against the actual failure mode (pattern-matching a `/tmp` push script); true closure needs the capability layer (read-scoped token + write-proxy), recorded as the north-star in the A3.

---

## [1.7.14] — 2026-07-22

**HG-5 enforced in code: an agent can no longer autonomously push AI-drafted grades to a live course.** (#207)

Closes the gap behind the KC3 grading-protocol RCA — 12 students received AI-drafted grades with no instructor review. HG-5 ("the instructor is the top layer — decision support, not autonomy") was a documented principle that nothing enforced past `--mark-reviewed`. Now it's enforced end-to-end, and the protocol is a single-sourced pointer in every course repo instead of prose that drifts.

### Changed
- **`grader_push.py`** — on the AI-drafted (LLM-comment) push path, `--yes` no longer bypasses the final `--push` confirmation. #97 closed this on `--mark-reviewed`; the same collapse of "grade" and "push" was still possible at the push step. An agent can pass `--yes`, but a human must physically type `push`. **Behavior change:** `grader_push.py --yes --push` on a run with per-student comment files now refuses and exits non-zero. The value-only / human-graded path (no comment files) keeps `--yes` — there the human is the grader.

### Added
- **`grader_push.py`** — a disclosure-tag validator refuses the push when a per-student comment file carries a deprecated tag format (older emoji/underscore variants), which would otherwise get the canonical `— AI drafted, instructor reviewed` tag stacked on top of it at send-time. Override: `--allow-bad-disclosure-tags`.
- **`sync_grading_protocol.py`** — new tool that injects the canonical HG-5 grading-protocol pointer into a course repo's `AGENTS.md`, idempotently (sentinel-marked) and dry-run-by-default. Retrofits repos initialized before #207, which `cb-init` never updates in place.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — a canonical "AI Grading Protocol — HG-5" section (the single source of truth the course-repo pointers link to). `cb-init` now emits that pointer into new course stubs, sharing one block with `sync_grading_protocol.py` so a fresh repo and a retrofitted one never disagree.

---

## [1.7.13] — 2026-07-22

**`sync --push` now creates a late policy when the course has none, instead of 404-ing on every push.** (#205)

`cmd_push` always sent `PATCH /courses/:id/late_policy` when `_course.json`'s `late_policy` hash differed from the stored index hash. Canvas only accepts `PATCH` once a late-policy record exists; a course that never configured one returns `The specified resource does not exist.` (404). #189 narrowed the `_course.json` hash to `late_policy`, which made an untouched course register as "changed" on the very next `--push` — so any operator who pulled #189 and pushed against a policy-free course hit that 404, and it recurred on every subsequent push because the hash never got to update. Non-blocking (the rest of the push proceeds), but persistent.

### Fixed
- **`canvas_sync.py`** — a new `_push_late_policy` helper `GET`s the late policy first and picks the verb: `PATCH` to update when one exists (200), `POST` to create when it doesn't (non-200). The success message reads `created` vs `updated` accordingly, and the accept check widened to `< 400` (matching the sibling homepage/syllabus handlers) so a `POST`-create isn't misread as a failure. Two unit tests cover both the update and create paths.

---

## [1.7.12] — 2026-07-15

**Transparency: every AI-drafted feedback comment is now tagged `— AI drafted, instructor reviewed` — default, no opt-out.**

Reframes the README's grading positioning from "the instructor stays the author" (which could read as passing AI-drafted feedback off as solely the instructor's) to honest disclosure, and backs it with a real mechanism so the claim is true, not just stated.

### Added
- **`append_disclosure_tag`** (`grader_push.py`) — appends `— AI drafted, instructor reviewed` to every AI-drafted feedback comment at send-time, applied by both `grader_push` and `grader_push_comments`. Idempotent (never double-tags on re-push); never invents a tag-only comment on a grade-only push. Honesty cuts both ways: only AI-drafted comments are tagged — a manual `default_comment` or a hand-written note (`submit_on_behalf`) is left alone.
- New architectural commitment in the README: **AI disclosure, no opt-out.**

### Changed
- README "Why this exists" / "What changes" reworked: the differentiator is now *honest disclosure of AI-assisted grading*, not who appears as the author.

## [1.7.11] — 2026-07-15

**`syllabus_audit`: comprehensive, evidence-grounded late-work detection.** (#140, by @thiebaudr-lab)

Grading/late detection missed common phrasing, so syllabi with a real policy were wrongly flagged incomplete. The detection vocabulary is now grounded in evidence — 32 live BYU-I syllabi + Canvas's own Late Policy UI ("late/missing submission").

### Changed
- **Comprehensive late-work detection** — added the real vocabulary (`late work`, `late assignment`, `late submission`, `submitted late`, `grace period`, `make-up work`, `grade/grading scheme`, …). Faculty write "late work", Canvas's feature says "late submission" — both are valid, so the audit just detects them all. No "conventional term" nagging.
- Dropped `"points possible"` — too generic (an assignment point value is not a grading policy; it risked false "present" verdicts, the audit's worst error).

### Added
- **Scoped image-only grade-scale warning** — when a grading section is present, the body has images, but no *plain-text* grade scale (letter→number mapping; a lone late-penalty "%" doesn't count), the audit flags that the scale may be image-only (invisible to screen readers and this audit). No longer fires on every decorative image.

_The syllabus-vs-Canvas late-policy mismatch check explored here is deferred to its own PR — it needs guards (skip template/master courses; require penalty-grade language) and an honest reframe that accounts for per-student / manual late-work enforcement._

---

## [1.7.10] — 2026-07-14

**`sync --status` / `--push` now report the course-level files (homepage, syllabus, `_course.json`) they write.** (#172, contributed by @matjmiles)

`cmd_status` diffed only `index["files"]`, but `cmd_push` also writes the homepage, syllabus, and `_course.json` (late_policy) — each tracked under its own index key, all before the "Nothing to push" guard. So `--status` could print "Everything up to date" while `--push` overwrote a live syllabus; and `--push` printed "Nothing to push" even when it had just pushed one. `--status` is the documented pre-push safety check, so under-reporting was the dangerous direction.

### Fixed
- **`canvas_sync.py`** — `cmd_status` diffs the course-level files via `_special_file_changes` (homepage/syllabus/`course_hash`, gated exactly like push), and `cmd_push`'s summary (`_push_summary`) names what it pushed instead of always saying "Nothing to push". Correctly scoped: it inspects only those three fixed keys, so it never reports the metadata sidecars (`_outcomes.json`, `_index.json`, ExternalUrl sidecars) that #173/#180 keep out of `index["files"]`. Added an integration test driving `cmd_status()` end-to-end (guards the wiring, not just the helper).

---

## [1.7.9] — 2026-07-13

**`submit_on_behalf` now uses Canvas's real proxy-submission path (GraphQL), not the REST endpoint that 403s on locked assignments.**

The tool posted to `POST .../assignments/:id/submissions` — a general grading call that respects the assignment lock and records no proxy submitter, so it was rejected on locked/past-due assignments (previously mis-attributed to an institutional block). The actual "Submit on behalf of student" feature is the GraphQL `createSubmission` mutation: passing `studentId` flips it into a proxy submission that checks the proxy-submission permission, skips the lock, and stamps `proxySubmitter` as evidence.

### Fixed
- **`submit_on_behalf.py`** — two-step proxy flow: upload the file into the student's submission files (`.../submissions/{user_id}/files`, so it's student-owned — the mutation rejects a file from the instructor's own files), then the `createSubmission` GraphQL mutation with `studentId`. Surfaces `proxySubmitter`; `--comment` is a separate REST call (the mutation takes none). Verified live against a Test Student (proxy_submitter stamped, file + comment landed). Documented as **L19** in `canvas_api_lessons_learned.md`.

---

## [1.7.8] — 2026-07-13

**`pull` stale-sweep no longer deletes metadata sidecars — the whole `_*.json` class is now protected.**

Follow-up to #173 (which fixed the ExternalUrl/ExternalTool sidecars). The stale-file sweep in `canvas_sync.py` (`_cleanup_stale_files`) globs `*.json` / `*.html` and deletes anything untracked; it only name-exempted `_module.json`. A `_*.json` at the course root is always a metadata sidecar, never a Canvas content mirror (`<slug>.json` / `<slug>.html`), so the whole class is now exempt. This fixes two live problems:

- **`_outcomes.json` self-deleted on every online pull** — the pull writes it (`canvas_sync.py:704`) but never tracked it, so the sweep removed it in the same run, silently leaving the local mirror without outcomes (broke `--local` CLO audits).
- **Offline write-path artifacts were exposed** — `offline_import`'s `_index.json` (the `ref→file` map `imscc_record` needs) and `_assignment_groups.json` would be swept if a `pull` ran over an offline-imported `course/`. (`.source.imscc` already survived — `.imscc` isn't globbed; `_course.json` was already protected.)

### Fixed
- `_cleanup_stale_files` exempts any `_*.json` (subsumes the `_module.json` exemption; keeps `*.questions.json` / `*.newquiz.json` and #173's `meta_paths`). 3 new tests in `test_canvas_sync_metadata_sidecars.py`: `_outcomes.json` survives the sweep, `_index.json` / `_assignment_groups.json` survive, and a genuinely stale non-underscore `<slug>.json` is still deleted.

---

## [1.7.7] — 2026-07-13

**Offline WRITE — record `course/` edits back into the source `.imscc` faithfully (`imscc_record`).**

Closes the offline loop: `course/` is the working folder (iterate freely; audits read it); the `.imscc` is the source of truth. When `course/` is final, `imscc_record` PATCHES only the fields `course/` tracks into the matching resources of the sidecar cartridge IN PLACE — everything else (quiz questions/QTI, `web_resources/`, LTI, rubric text, formatting) is copied byte-for-byte. It patches an already-valid Canvas cartridge; it never rebuilds.

### Added
- **`imscc_record`** — mirror `course/` → the source `.imscc`. Patches assignment title/dates/points/workflow_state/submission_types/grading_type/group/description, quiz title/dates/published/group (never questions), page HTML, module names/order/published/item order, assignment-group names/weights, outcomes, and syllabus — joining each item to its source resource by the preserved identifier. Self-validates (blocks only shift-*introduced* issues) and updates `course/.source.imscc` in place (or `--output`). Reusable core `mirror_course_into_imscc` in `_imscc.py`.
- **`offline_import` saves the source cartridge** as `course/.source.imscc` (byte-for-byte) so the mirror has a faithful base to patch, plus `course/_index.json` — an EXACT `identifierref → file` map. A resource can be an item in several modules under different per-module titles (and unfiled items are in no module at all), so the mirror joins on this recorded path, never a title/slug guess — which would otherwise silently drop an item or map the wrong file. Unfiled assignments/quizzes are now recordable too. Both are invisible to the loader (top-level `_` files / it globs `*/_module.json`).
- Tier-1 tests (`test_imscc_record.py`) — tracked tags set to `course/` values; quiz QTI + `web_resources/` bytes identical before/after; clean validation; the identifier join (incl. a resource shared across modules under different titles, and an unfiled resource); a loud error when `_index.json` is missing; byte-for-byte idempotence on a no-op mirror. Verified against a real Canvas export: 75/75 assignments map, edits patch only their own resource, quiz QTI preserved byte-for-byte.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-07-12

**Offline mode — run the whole audit + gradebook + content-package workflow without a Canvas API token.**

Tools now read a local `course/` folder (populated by `canvas_sync --pull` from the API *or* `offline_import` from a `.imscc`), so they run identically online and offline. Online stays the default; `--local` is additive — nothing existing changes.

### Added
- **Offline foundation:** `CANVAS_MODE` + gradebook-CSV utils + download finders (#141); gradebook **de-identify / re-identify** (#142); **apply-scores** to a gradebook CSV (#143); `.imscc` **date-shift** + validator for a semester copy (#144); the local **`course/` loader** (#146); **`offline_import`** (`.imscc → course/`) (#147); cross-validation of the full `.imscc → course/ → audit` pipeline (#148).
- **7 audits gained `--local`:** `workload` (#146), `syllabus` (#149), `accessibility` + `content_representation` (#150), `grading_structure` (#152), `rubric_coverage` + `rubric_quality` (#154), with **exact online/offline parity** including outcomes (#155).
- **`clo_catalog_import`** — pull a course's CLOs from the institution's Kuali catalog and create them as Canvas Outcomes (API-only, guarded, idempotent, text-normalized) (#160).
- **`syllabus_audit` is institution-agnostic** — BYUI profile via host inference / `CANVAS_INSTITUTION` / `--institution`, not hardcoded (#156).

### Changed
- **Cloudflare Workers migrated out** to the `edge-infra` sister repo; `canvas-toolbox/infra/` removed and references repointed (the deployed `canvas-toolbox-bugs` worker is unaffected) (#159).
- Offline guides rewritten to match the shipped architecture (#145, #151); roadmap updates for the CLO importer (#157, #161).

### Fixed
- `imscc_adjust_dates` blocks only shift-*introduced* issues, not pre-existing source quirks (#153).
- PUBH field deployment feedback — 5 items (#139).

## [1.6.1] — 2026-07-08

**Accommodation system performance + reliability fix**

Addresses the accommodation force-recalc "working 0-100% of the time" issue reported in production. Root cause: force_recalc was iterating ALL assignments in the course (200+) instead of only the modified assignments, causing 10+ minute hangs on slow Canvas instances.

### Fixed
- **student_late_accommodation.py** — now passes specific assignment_ids to force_recalc (50-100x faster)
  - Before: 200+ API calls to check every assignment in course
  - After: 3-5 API calls to check only modified assignments
  - Runtime: 10+ minutes → seconds
- **student_quiz_time_extension.py** — extracts assignment_id from graded quizzes for targeted recalc
  - Practice quizzes/surveys (no assignment_id) now skip recalc appropriately
  - More accurate messaging when no assignment overrides exist

### Added (reliability improvements to _override_recalc_helper.py)
- **verify_override_updated()** — workaround for Canvas Issue #1774 (stale data after PUT)
- **_request_with_backoff()** — exponential backoff for 429 rate limiting (1s, 2s, 4s retries)
- All API calls now use backoff logic (GET assignments, GET overrides, PUT override)

### Documentation
- **docs/research/accommodation-recalc-findings.md** — comprehensive deep dive on Canvas override recalc mechanism, API research, and implementation plan

## [1.6.0] — 2026-07-07

**Major: v1.6 course-centric architecture refactor**

Breaking change for multi-course instructors: course files (.env, AGENTS.md, course/, grading/, handoffs/) now live at course root (DS460/), not inside canvas-toolbox/. This eliminates "which canvas-toolbox folder is this?" confusion when teaching multiple courses.

### Added
- **cb-init auto-detects subdirectory context** — when run from DS460/canvas-toolbox/, creates course files at DS460/ automatically (no manual copying)
- **4 new cb-init steps** (now 13 total):
  - Step 10: Create .gitignore at course root (subdirectory mode)
  - Step 11: Run canvas-sync --pull to populate course/ directory
  - Step 12: Generate course-specific AGENTS.md stub (references toolkit AGENTS.md)
  - Step 13: Create handoffs/ directory (opt-in via --with-handoffs flag)
- **--with-handoffs flag** — creates handoffs/ directory for AI session tracking (dev/power-user feature, opt-in)
- **v1.5 → v1.6 migration detection** — cb-init detects .env at old location (canvas-toolbox/.env) and offers to migrate to course root

### Changed
- **.env location in subdirectory mode** — DS460/.env instead of DS460/canvas-toolbox/.env
- **Course-root .gitignore auto-created** — includes .env, canvas-toolbox/, course/, grading/, handoffs/
- **AGENTS.md structure section updated** — documents v1.6 architecture and course-root working directory
- **cb-init step count** — 9 steps → 13 steps
- **Test expectations updated** — test_cb_init.py now expects 13 steps

### Technical
- Added `detect_course_context()` function to distinguish subdirectory vs standalone mode
- Course root detection uses parent folder name heuristics (dev folders vs course folders)
- Migration uses shutil.move for .env relocation
- Backward compatible: standalone mode (canvas-toolbox/ as repo root) unchanged
- Implementation plan: docs/proposals/v1.6-cb-init-refactor-plan.md

### Migration Guide
For existing v1.5 users with course files in canvas-toolbox/:

**Automated migration (recommended)**:
```bash
python3 canvas-toolbox/scaffold/migrate_v15_to_v16.py        # dry-run (shows what it would do)
python3 canvas-toolbox/scaffold/migrate_v15_to_v16.py --apply  # actually move files
uv run python canvas-toolbox/lib/tools/cb_init.py           # finish setup
```

This moves .env, course/, grading/, .canvas/ to course root, then cb-init creates .gitignore and AGENTS.md.

**Manual migration**: Re-run cb-init from canvas-toolbox/. It will detect your old .env and offer to migrate it (but you'll need to manually move course/, grading/, .canvas/).

See docs/UPGRADING.md for detailed migration steps.

## [1.5.4] — 2026-07-07

**Bug fixes and dependency updates**

### Fixed
- **student_late_accommodation.py default changed to `--no-force-recalc`** — prevents
  10+ minute hangs on slow Canvas courses. Canvas automatically recognizes overrides
  within minutes; forced recalculation is now opt-in via `--force-recalc` flag.
  Fixes #138.
- **engagement audit HTTPS prepending** — `course_engagement_audit.py` now correctly
  prepends `https://` to base URL when missing, matching other Canvas API tools.
  Fixes PR #137.
- **cb_init test updated for 9 steps** — `test_cb_init.py` was checking for 8 steps
  but cb_init now has 9 steps (Rust installation added in v1.5.x). Test now correctly
  expects 9 steps.

### Changed
- **Dependency updates** — anthropic 0.113.0 → 0.116.0, markdownify 1.2.2 → 1.2.3.
  PR #133.

## [1.5.3] — 2026-07-07

**YAML frontmatter migration (industry compliance)**

### Changed
- **All 7 agents migrated from MD+JSON to MD+YAML frontmatter** — follows
  industry standard pattern (Anthropic Agent Skills, agentskills.io, Make-AI-Agents).
  Zero major platforms use separate JSON companion files.
- **canvas_api_tool.py updated with YAML parser** — new `load_agent_config()`
  function extracts structured data from YAML frontmatter + embedded YAML code blocks.
- **Zero functional changes** — all tools work identically, smoke tests pass.

### Removed
- **All 7 agent JSON files** — canvas_blueprint_sync.json, canvas_content_sync.json,
  canvas_course_expert.json, canvas_grader.json, canvas_schedule_auditor.json,
  canvas_semester_setup.json, ira_program_alignment.json. Data now embedded in
  corresponding .md files.

### Technical
- Created `lib/tools/_migrate_agent_to_yaml.py` — migration script for MD+JSON → MD+YAML.
- `load_agent_config()` parser uses `yaml.safe_load()` + regex to extract YAML blocks.
- Embedded YAML blocks preserve audit_rules, byui_standards, llm_agent config for
  runtime use by canvas_api_tool.py.
- YAML frontmatter contains metadata (name, version, description, complexity, agent_type).

## [1.5.2] — 2026-07-07

**Rust engagement audit (10-20x speedup for Title IV compliance)**

### Added
- **Rust implementation of `course_engagement_audit.py`** — 10-20x speedup
  (5-10 minutes → 30-60 seconds) for courses with 100+ students. Uses concurrent
  per-student HTTP requests (tokio + reqwest) instead of sequential Python loops.
  Bottleneck: 3 API endpoints per student (submissions, discussions, quiz data).
- **Python fallback implementation** (`_course_engagement_audit_python.py`) —
  sequential implementation matching original behavior. Slower than Rust but works
  without Rust installed.
- **Dispatcher pattern in `course_engagement_audit.py`** — automatically detects
  Rust binary (`lib/tools/engagement_audit_rs/target/release/engagement-audit`),
  falls back to Python if not found with performance warning.

### Changed
- **Engagement audit tool now has Rust acceleration** — Title IV unofficial
  withdrawal audits for large courses (100+ students) now complete in under a
  minute instead of 5-10 minutes. Tool still works without Rust (Python fallback).

### Technical
- Created `lib/tools/engagement_audit_rs/` — Rust crate using tokio for async
  HTTP, reqwest for Canvas API calls, serde for JSON serialization.
- Output format matches Python implementation exactly (JSON array of per-student
  engagement data: submission timestamps, discussion timestamps).
- FERPA boundary preserved: Rust handles only anonymous user_id + timestamps;
  Python layer handles name re-identification and classification logic.

---

## [1.5.1] — 2026-07-07

**Python fallback for override recalculation (no Rust required)**

### Added
- **Python fallback implementation** (`_fix_group_override_recalc_python.py`) —
  sequential implementation of override recalculation logic. Slower than Rust
  (5-10 minutes vs 5-15 seconds for 100+ assignments) but works without any
  additional setup.
- **Dispatcher pattern** in `fix_group_override_recalc.py` — automatically
  detects Rust binary availability and falls back to Python if not found.
  Warns users about performance difference and suggests Rust install.

### Changed
- **Override recalc tool now works without Rust** — graceful degradation when
  Rust binary not available. Users get clear warning about slower performance
  and instructions for installing Rust, but tool completes successfully.

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-07-07

**Rust opt-in for 10-100x speedup on large courses**

### Added
- **Rust implementation of `fix_group_override_recalc.py`** — 10-100x speedup
  (5-10 minutes → 5-15 seconds) for courses with 100+ assignments. Uses
  concurrent HTTP requests (tokio + reqwest) instead of sequential Python loops.
- **`cb-init --with-rust` flag** — opt-in Rust installation during bootstrap.
  Manual install instructions shown in v1.5.0; auto-install deferred to v1.5.1.
  Rust is optional in v1.5.x, will become required in v2.x.

### Changed
- **Version scheme bumped to v1.5.0** — signals the start of the hybrid
  Python+Rust transition phase. See [Rust migration strategy](docs/proposals/rust-migration-3-phase-strategy.md)
  for the 3-phase roadmap (v1.x Python-only → v1.5.x hybrid → v2.x Rust-required).
- **README updated** — documents `cb-init --with-rust` for large-course
  performance optimization; adds performance note to `fix_group_override_recalc`
  section.

### Fixed
- **PR #136** — merged Rust rewrite with improved error messaging when Rust
  binary not found (directs users to `cb-init --with-rust`).

---

## [0.72.3] — 2026-06-29

### Changed
- **AGENTS.md trimmed to the rotating latest-5 rule.** Active Context had grown
  into an append-only release log (182 KB / ~32k tokens — past host-tool read
  limits). Now keeps only the 5 most-recent entries (~570 lines / ~10k tokens);
  older entries relocated here, filling the prior 0.51–0.71 gap. Per make_AGENTS
  Principle #2 (concise first-read context).
- **README footer + AGENTS.md pointer** now point release history at this file.

### Added
- `lib/tests/test_agents_active_context.py` — CI guard enforcing ≤5 Active
  Context entries (local enforcement of [Make-AI-Agents#17](https://github.com/chaz-clark/Make-AI-Agents/issues/17)).

### Fixed
- 17 outbound links in `docs/grading-readme.md`, `docs/UPGRADING.md`, and
  `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` that broke in v0.72.2 when those files moved out of
  the repo root (their root-relative links were not re-pathed at the time).
- 8 pre-existing broken relative links in `lib/agents/` (wrong relative depth / missing `knowledge/` prefix; two `forthcoming` references de-linked).

---

## [0.72.2] — 2026-06-29

Docs/structure patch — marketing-ready landing experience. No code or test
changes (605 tests unchanged).

### Changed
- **Setup moved to the top of the README** — `Getting started` (Steps 1–3)
  now follows the tagline immediately, ahead of the pitch sections.
- **Added a three-box launchpad** ("What you'll do most": Build & revise ·
  Audit & improve · Grade), each linking to its deep section.
- **Added an advanced multi-course option** (Orca) to Step 1, for running the
  toolkit across several course repos in parallel — alternative to a single IDE.

### Moved
- Decluttered the repo root listing (18 → 12 tracked files): community-health
  files (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`) → `.github/`
  (still GitHub-detected); long docs (`UPGRADING.md`, `grading-readme.md`) →
  `docs/`. All internal links repointed; 0 broken links repo-wide.

## [0.72.1] — 2026-06-26

**README polish — surface quiz time extension + fix late-work intro**


**v0.72.1** — docs-only patch addressing three gaps Chaz flagged
after a post-v0.72.0 README review:

1. `student_quiz_time_extension.py` had no standalone surface — only
   appeared as a dispatcher target. A faculty member with an informal
   "give Ada 1.5x time" couldn't find it. Added a **13th workflow
   row** + a dedicated README section between the late-work and SAS
   dispatcher sections.

2. Late-work intro paragraph still said overrides "drop the close
   date" as if that were the only behavior — but v0.72.0 added the
   `--shift-by-days` flavor. Rewrote the intro to mention both
   flavors so the "Two flavors" table that follows doesn't feel
   contradictory.

3. Workflow row for "Give one student late-work accommodation" was
   ~3x wider than its neighbors because of inline `--shift-by-days`
   detail. Tightened by moving specifics to the dedicated section
   and linking out.

Test count unchanged (605). No code change.

## [0.72.0] — 2026-06-26

**BYUI SAS accommodation sprint — quiz time extension + test_reschedule + apply dispatcher**


**v0.72.0** — three-item sprint closing out the BYUI Accessibility
Services catalog dispatch chain. Triggered by the life-pm handoff at
`handoffs/2026-06-26-accessibility-accommodations-catalog.md`.

**S1 — `lib/tools/student_quiz_time_extension.py`** (~265 lines).
Per-student quiz time multiplier (1.5x, 2.0x, or any > 1.0). Targets
CLASSIC Canvas quizzes only (New Quizzes documented as a follow-up).
Pulls quiz `time_limit` from API; computes `extra_time` minutes via
`ceil(time_limit * (multiplier - 1))`; POSTs to `/quizzes/<id>/extensions`
with `quiz_extensions[][user_id]` + `quiz_extensions[][extra_time]`.
Scopes: `--quiz-id` (one) or `--all-timed` (every timed quiz in
course). PII-free via `--user-id` or `--deid-code` lookup. Auto-skips
untimed quizzes. Pure-helper `compute_extra_minutes` uses `math.ceil`
so partial minutes always round UP — the student never gets less time
than the multiplier promises.

**S2 — `--shift-by-days N` mode on `student_late_accommodation.py`**.
For SAS `test_reschedule` (distinct from `occasional_extensions`):
shift unlock/due/lock forward by N days instead of dropping lock_at.
New pure helper `shift_iso_timestamp(ts, days)` advances the date
prefix of an ISO 8601 string while preserving the time-of-day and
timezone suffix (no full tz parser needed — string-prefix arithmetic
is sufficient for accommodation-grade precision). New
`build_shift_payload(assignment, user_id, days)` is the
analog of `build_override_payload` but emits all three dates shifted.

**S3 — `lib/tools/apply_sas_accommodations.py`** (~280 lines). YAML
dispatcher. Reads `grading/.sas_accommodations.yml`, walks each
student × accommodation, classifies each `key` into one of 4 tiers
(`canvas` / `proctoring` / `policy` / `unknown`). Canvas-tier
accommodations are invoked as subprocess calls to the matching tool
(so each tool stays standalone, no cross-tool imports). Proctoring +
policy tiers surface as a one-line operator checklist. Audit trail
written to `grading/.sas_accommodations_applied.log` (FERPA tier 2,
gitignored). Catalog hard-coded in three frozen sets at the top of
the module — single source of truth, easy to extend when life-pm
surfaces new accommodation types.

**Knowledge file — `lib/agents/knowledge/sas_accommodations_knowledge.md`**
vendors the life-pm catalog into the canvas-toolbox knowledge surface
so future agents can reason about SAS dispatch without re-reading the
handoff each time. Maps every catalog key → tier → tool invocation;
documents the YAML handoff schema; explains the
"how to add a new key" extension process.

**README — 12th workflow row + dedicated SAS section** between
the de-id master section and "Sharing your grader." Late-work
accommodation section now distinguishes the two flavors (drop lock_at
for `occasional_extensions` vs `--shift-by-days N` for
`test_reschedule`) in addition to the four scoping modes.

**55 new tests passing** (605 passing total, up from 550):
- 21 tests for quiz time extension (compute_extra_minutes ceil
  behavior, filter_timed_quizzes, payload shape, master lookup edge
  cases)
- 12 new tests for shift-by-days mode (shift_iso_timestamp edge
  cases: month/year boundaries, timezone preservation, null
  passthrough, negative-days defensive; build_shift_payload all-three-
  dates invariant)
- 22 tests for SAS dispatcher (classify_key for all catalog members,
  plan_one_accommodation for each canvas-tier key with default + YAML
  overrides, plan_entries flatten/skip/order behavior, audit-line
  format invariants)

**What's NOT yet done (deferred):**
- New Quizzes (LTI) support — they use a different endpoint
- `apply_sas_accommodations.py` is invoked manually; future work
  could wire it into a daily/weekly cron or post-fetch hook

## [0.71.0] — 2026-06-26

**Path A migration — `.known_names.txt` auto-derived from the de-id master**


**v0.71.0** — Path A of the de-id master consolidation. Mid-build
operator question after v0.70.0 shipped: *"Do all de-id scripts run
off the new master? Anything re-id'ed goes to Downloads?"* — surfaced
that the master was purely additive (only 2 tools used it); the
scrub-pass roster `.known_names.txt` was still populated separately
by `grader_fetch.py`.

**What landed:**

1. **`build_deid_master.py` now auto-derives `.known_names.txt`** —
   single new helper `render_known_names_lines()` emits BOTH sortable
   ("Lastname, Firstname") and display ("Firstname Lastname") forms
   per student so the scrub matches whichever literal appears in
   submission text. Case-insensitive dedup; sorted; header comments
   so a future reader doesn't hand-edit it.

2. **7 new tests** (550 passing total, up from 543). Covers both-forms
   emission, header comments, dedup, empty-name skip, single-word
   names (no comma → no display-form duplicate), determinism, sort
   order.

**Unchanged (deliberate):**
- `grader_fetch.py`'s `update_known_names()` still works as before
  (append-mode dedup; appends submitters who weren't in the People
  view yet). Path A is additive, not replacement.
- Per-assignment keymaps untouched. Grader pipeline hot path unchanged.

**Path B deferred** — full migration where the master replaces
per-assignment keymaps for the grader pipeline — approved in principle
but deferred to a future session per operator direction. Path B becomes
harder over time; the deferral is intentional and credit-aware.

## [0.70.0] — 2026-06-26

**Course-wide de-id master + per-student late-work accommodation primitives**


**v0.70.0** — closes issue #109 (agent-submitted ~10 min after v0.69.1
shipped, from the DS 460 pilot). Two related primitives + four-mode
scoping + the README cleanups Chaz flagged mid-build.

**The missing primitive** — until v0.70.0, the toolkit could de-identify
within a single grading workflow (per-assignment keymaps) and could
scrub names (.known_names.txt) but had NO course-wide stable
`code ↔ user_id ↔ name` surface. That's the primitive every keyed /
FERPA workflow actually wants — and it's what enables the accommodation
tool to take `--deid-code S-68BC40` instead of `--user-id 900001`
(so the operator never speaks the student's name to the agent).

**What landed:**

1. **`lib/tools/build_deid_master.py`** — fetches Canvas People with
   ALL enrollment states (active + invited + inactive + completed),
   hashes user_id → `S-XXXXXX` (6 hex from sha256, configurable
   prefix + hash-bits), writes `grading/.deid_master.csv` (FERPA
   tier 2). Auto-writes `grading/.gitignore` to make tier 2 bulletproof.
   Detects collisions at write-time with clear recovery message
   (`--hash-bits 8`). Default prefix `S-`; opt out via `--prefix`.

2. **`lib/tools/student_late_accommodation.py`** — lifted from DS 460
   pilot + generalized. Writes per-student assignment overrides that
   keep `unlock_at` + `due_at` but omit `lock_at` (no close date).
   **Four scoping modes** (the v0.70.0 mid-build operator ask):
   - `--assignment-id` — ONE assignment
   - `--all` — every published, backdated
   - `--from YYYY-MM-DD` — due on/after a specific date
   - `--from-days-ago N` — rolling window (recommended default; e.g.
     `--from-days-ago 14` = last 2 weeks through end of term)
   Resolves student via `--user-id` OR `--deid-code` (PII-free).
   `--remove` flag works with any scope.

3. **`lib/agents/knowledge/deid_master_knowledge.md`** — the
   4-column contract, collision math, FERPA tier 2 explanation,
   how downstream tools should consume the master (never read
   `sortable_name` unless explicit).

4. **54 new tests passing** (543 passing total, up from 489;
   Title IV pure-helper pattern continued — function in/out, no
   Canvas API mocking).

5. **README mid-build tweaks** (Chaz-flagged):
   - Step 3 prompt now explicitly invokes `cb-init` (so the agent
     uses our purpose-built idempotent bootstrap, not its own ad-hoc
     sequence)
   - `byui.instructure.com` → `your-institution.instructure.com`
     (generic across institutions)
   - "Who uses it" section DROPPED (was leading with BYUI specifics)
   - "Sharing back with the project" SIMPLIFIED from a technical
     PATH/fallback wall to a 3-row agent-prompt table
   - 11th workflow row added: "Give one student late-work accommodation"
   - NEW dedicated section "Per-student late-work accommodation"
     with the 4-mode scope table
   - Trailing version line names the new primitives

**Field validation** (from issue #109 author):
- DS 460 pilot: 1 real student, 36 assignments, `--all` applied
  cleanly — every override kept original open/due with lock=null
- 30 active → 37 total → 7 withdrawn surfaced (the `withdrawn` flag's
  value, hidden by the active-only People view)
- Canvas GET overrides slow-path caveat baked into the tool: APPLY
  POSTs directly without listing existing overrides; only REMOVE reads

## [0.69.1] — 2026-06-26

**README streamline — cut technical setup options + surface AI architect capability**

**v0.69.1** — docs-only patch. Two operator-flagged issues:

1. **Setup steps had too many forks** — the non-technical
   agent-driven prompt was buried under TL;DR one-liner + Option B
   (manual fast-path cb-init + manual long path) + Option C. Cut
   Option B entirely. Cut TL;DR one-liner. Promoted Option A as
   THE path; faculty pastes one prompt to their agent and the
   agent handles git/uv/Python/deps. Option C (colleague-handover)
   retained as a small sub-section. Migration paragraph kept as
   one-line footer for existing users.

   **Rationale:** technical users will figure it out without
   instructions; the README's job is to lower the bar for
   non-technical faculty. Forks confuse the audience that needs
   the most hand-holding.

2. **AI architect capability not surfaced** — the toolkit ships
   with 20+ pedagogical knowledge files (backwards design / Hattie
   3-phase / Merrill / Kolb / Cognitive Load Theory / AAC&U
   rubrics / Carnegie workload / etc.) that the agent uses when
   designing a NEW course or redesigning an existing one. README
   only documented audit / sync / grade flows — never said the
   toolkit can help you BUILD a course. Added:

   - **10th agent-prompt row**: *"Design or improve a course (AI
     architect)"* — links to dedicated section
   - **NEW dedicated section** *"Architecting a course with AI
     assistance"* between Step 3 and Auditing — names the 22
     design-relevant knowledge files in a table, names the
     prompt, names the 6 things the agent walks the faculty
     through (CLOs → assessments → module sequence → rubrics →
     workload → accessibility), keeps the *"you stay the
     architect; AI is the assistant"* framing

**No code changes.** No new tests required. Version triple-sync
0.69.0 → 0.69.1 (patch — docs only). 483 tests unchanged.

## [0.69.0] — 2026-06-26

**Title IV course-engagement audit + Downloads-folder FERPA tier 3**

**v0.69.0** — new audit tool category: federal Title IV last-date-
of-engagement classifier for UW/UF reporting (R2T4 candidates).
Establishes a **new FERPA tier**: named reports outside the repo
entirely (LLM has no working-directory access to `~/Downloads/`).

**Why:** federal Title IV (34 CFR 668.22) requires faculty /
institutions to report last-date-of-academic-engagement for any
student who unofficially withdraws. Manual workflow: trawl
SpeedGrader + Discussions + Quizzes per student at term-end.

**What landed:**

1. **`lib/tools/course_engagement_audit.py`** — fetches assignments
   + quizzes + discussion entries per enrolled student, computes
   `last_engagement` as max timestamp (deliberately EXCLUDES
   `last_activity_at` and page views per DOE *"logging in is not
   sufficient"*), classifies into ACTIVE / UW / UF /
   NEVER_PARTICIPATED against operator-provided UF cutoff,
   re-identifies user_id → name ONLY at the last step, writes
   PDF + MD to `~/Downloads/`. Hard refuses to write inside cwd
   (FERPA tier 3 defense-in-depth).

2. **`lib/tools/update_title_iv_snapshot.py`** — companion tool.
   Fetches 6 canonical Title IV sources, regex-extracts body
   content (no LLM tokens; deterministic), writes Markdown
   snapshots + sha256 manifest. Mozilla UA to avoid anti-scraping
   shells; content-length sanity check.

3. **6 cached Title IV sources** (~674k chars total) at
   `lib/agents/knowledge/sources/title_iv/` — CFR 668.22, FSA
   Handbook Vol 5 Ch 1/2/3 + Vol 2 Ch 1, Federal Register final
   rules effective 2026-07-01. Auditable provenance.

4. **NEW knowledge file** `course_engagement_audit_knowledge.md` —
   Title IV research foundation + classification rules +
   Downloads-folder pattern + re-verification cadence.

5. **`grader_knowledge.md §1` extended** — "two zones" → "three
   tiers." NEW tier 3: named reports outside the repo entirely.

6. **44 new tests** (483 total, up from 439).

7. **README updated** — 9th agent-prompt row added; new "Title IV
   last-participation audit" section; comparison table gains a
   Title IV row; trailing version line names verification date.

**Title IV verification date stamp: 2026-06-26. Next review:
2027-06-26.** The new Distance Ed + R2T4 final rules go into
effect **2026-07-01** (this week at time of build) — the cached
Federal Register snapshot captures their canonical text.

Operator's specific asks all honored:
- ✅ "Research with confirm" — 4 parallel WebSearches; findings
  synthesized in the knowledge file with explicit Title IV
  citations
- ✅ "Document in the readme.md" — capability bullet + dedicated
  section + comparison table + agent-prompt row
- ✅ "Date of update incase title iv updates" — verification date
  + next-review date at top of knowledge file + in README + in
  manifest + in tool docstring
- ✅ "Never participated also in scope" — 4 buckets (ACTIVE /
  UW / UF / NEVER_PARTICIPATED)
- ✅ "PDF" — primary output format; MD as editable source
- ✅ "Root level Downloads" — top-level `~/Downloads/`
- ✅ "Match Title IV naming but allow them to call it last
  participation check" — file is `course_engagement_audit.py`
  (matches existing audit naming); agent recognizes prompts like
  "UW check", "last participation report", "engagement audit"
- ✅ "I like the separation of storage as a rule to enhance our
  FERPA position" — documented as FERPA tier 3 in
  `grader_knowledge.md §1`
- ✅ "Save the Title IV resources and produce an update script" —
  `update_title_iv_snapshot.py` + 6 cached sources + manifest
- ✅ "Regex the tags needed from the html to reduce token useage" —
  regex-only extraction; no LLM tokens used; deterministic; sha256
  manifest skips unchanged sources on re-run

**README rebalance — broader toolbox positioning + 8-workflow agent-prompt list**

**v0.68.2** — second README correction after operator feedback on
v0.68.1: *"overall the rest is too grader heavy focused - this tool
does so much more, grader is a key compoennt and probably the
marketing one but we cant turn the toolbox into a grader only"* +
*"the 'what it looks like in practice' should be a positive
experience"* + *"we need the list of how to use it back to prompt
ideas again of all 8 tools"*

**Six structural changes:**

1. **Intro grammar fixes** — *"you're always in the loop"* (was
   *"your"*) and *"everything in Canvas"* (was lowercase). Operator-
   authored intro otherwise preserved.
2. **"What it looks like in practice" replaced** — was a negative
   example (regression gate refusing a lower). Now a POSITIVE example
   showing `_all_comments.md` ready for review + per-student evidence
   files generated. Ends with *"Nothing pushes to Canvas until you
   mark reviewed"* — reassurance, not threat.
3. **NEW section: "What you can ask your AI agent to do"** — 8-row
   table of prompt-shaped workflows (sync, quick audit, full audit,
   course map, NQ response data, grading, cross-faculty sharing,
   semester rollout). The most adopter-friendly part of the legacy
   README; restored in marketing-shaped form.
4. **"Why this exists" rebalanced** — opens with *"Your course is a
   document. The boring parts… should be your call."* The wedge story
   is still grading (the marketing centerpiece) but the framing now
   covers ALL workflows.
5. **"What changes" table restructured** — was AI-grading-as-a-service
   vs Canvas Toolbox (grader-only). Now Canvas-UI-alone vs Canvas
   Toolbox across SIX workflows: editing, auditing, grading, sharing,
   semester rollout, NQ response data.
6. **"What you can trust" split into two sub-sections** —
   (a) Architectural commitments that apply everywhere (FERPA two-
   zone + voice-preservation + brain-agnostic + read-only-audits +
   local-source-of-truth); (b) Grading safety gates (the 11 — still
   present but framed as the highest-stakes-workflow specifics).

**Length:** 474 lines (up from v0.68.1's 447). Adds the 8-workflow
table; the rebalance otherwise didn't add net length.

**No code changes; 439 tests passing; pre-commit green.**

Ships via PR (second use of branch protection's PR flow).

## [0.68.1] — 2026-06-26

**README correction — restored faculty install scaffold + voice rewrite in Chaz's voice**

**v0.68.1** — corrects v0.68.0 after operator feedback: *"the quick
start is too small compared to the old readme.md remember our
audiance is mostly non-technical faculty you lost our audiance with
your research of GH"* and *"your voicing is too AI for the readme.md
you should scal all my *-master courses for their voicing."*

**Two things were wrong with v0.68.0:**

1. **Audience mismatch.** v0.68.0 was researched against top-starred
   GH READMEs (Astro, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, etc.) — all aimed at
   developer-fluent audiences. canvas-toolbox's audience is
   non-technical faculty. The legacy 862-line README's verbose
   Step 1/2/3 install scaffold wasn't bloat — it was THE entry
   point. v0.68.0 compressed install to ~5 lines + TODO links.
   That's wrong for the audience.

2. **Voice mismatch.** The v0.68.0 prose read as marketing-formal
   ("The architectural commitment isn't rhetoric. It's enforced in
   code") — not Chaz's voice. Six parallel Explore agents scanned
   `*-master` repos (itm327, ds250-onln, ds250-onml, ds460, m119,
   cse450) to extract Chaz's actual writing voice from his
   README.md / AGENTS.md / handoffs/. Consistent signature
   surfaced: short + punchy alternated with structured detail;
   imperative + consequence ("Edit X first. Never push Y."); "This
   is / This is NOT" scope framing; "My lean:" for opinions;
   "Source of truth:" framing; "Note:" / "Never..." / "Always..."
   markers; explicit trade-offs with named costs; no marketing
   speak ("leveraging", "seamlessly", "powerful"); no hedging
   ("might", "perhaps", "may want to").

**The fix:**

1. **Restored** the full Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 install scaffold
   from the legacy README. Step 1 (pick an IDE) + Step 2 (pick an
   AI assistant) + Step 3 (TL;DR / Option A agent-driven / Option B
   manual / Option C colleague-handover / migration). Plus the
   audit-tool catalog + grading pipeline detail (condensed but
   present, not TODO-linked).
2. **Rewrote** the prose throughout in Chaz's voice. Marketing
   wedge + safety-gate table kept (those landed well in v0.68.0);
   the connective tissue is now matter-of-fact + imperative + no
   filler. Example: v0.68.0 said *"Eleven coded safety gates like
   this one stand between AI-assisted grading and the student's
   gradebook — accumulated from real lived failures, not
   speculative design."* v0.68.1 says: *"Eleven safety gates
   between AI-assisted grading and the student's gradebook. Each
   one came from a real incident. Each one shipped within hours of
   being filed."*
3. **Length** — 447 lines (up from v0.68.0's 206, down from
   legacy's 862). The audit-tool catalog stays inline; grading
   pipeline links to `grading-readme.md`; no TODO links to
   nonexistent `INSTALL.md` / `OPERATIONS.md` (those references
   were premature in v0.68.0 — the legacy is still in
   `lib/marketing/README-LEGACY-2026-06-26.md` as source material
   if those docs are extracted later).
4. **Voice research** captured to
   `handoffs/2026-06-26_chaz-voice-extraction.md` (gitignored;
   six per-repo agent reports synthesized).

**Branch protection — first PR-flow test.** v0.68.1 ships via PR
on `feat/readme-restore-faculty-scaffold` branch (not direct push)
since branch protection went live earlier this session. CI
required + linear history + force-push-blocked. Auto-merge on CI
green.

## [0.68.0] — 2026-06-26

**Marketing-perspective README pass — Phase 2**

**v0.68.0** — replaces the 862-line developer-doc README with a
206-line marketing-pass README. Research-grounded redesign per the
operator's 2026-06-26 ask. Same Option C delivery shape as v0.65.0
voice coaching: research synthesis + draft + ship.

**The wedge story made operational:**

The new README leads with the **shadcn/ui-style category reframe**:

> "This is not an AI grader. It is how an instructor uses AI to
> grade *with* them — staying the author of every grade and every
> word the student reads."

That's the parking-lot positioning work (instructor-author vs
AI-author wedge from 2026-06-24 meeting) made into the README's
opening promise. Everything else flows from there: the FERPA
two-zone architecture, the voice-preservation contract, the 11
safety gates, the cross-faculty sharing pattern.

**Six top-starred GH repos researched** (anthropics/claude-code,
shadcn-ui/ui, withastro/astro, tailwindlabs/tailwindcss,
ollama/ollama, continuedev/continue) for structural + marketing
patterns. Headline finding: every one of them is dramatically shorter
than canvas-toolbox's prior 862 lines (mean 108). The new draft at
206 lines is a 76% reduction while keeping more "why" framing than
typical (canvas-toolbox's category isn't established yet — needs
the positioning section).

**Seven cross-cutting patterns applied:**

1. **One-line value hook** — `"FERPA-safe AI-assisted Canvas LMS
   toolkit. Your voice. Your accountability. Your students' privacy."`
2. **Category reframe** — shadcn/ui pattern; the "not X, is how
   you Y" inversion
3. **Visual above-the-fold** — synthetic terminal-output example
   showing the regression gate firing (Claude Code demo-GIF analog)
4. **Install front-loaded** — single-line install at line ~85 with
   link to dedicated `INSTALL.md` (TODO follow-up doc)
5. **Adoption signals as scannable table** — 11 safety gates with
   a 1-line description of what each one prevents (Ollama
   ecosystem-flex analog, but with safety gates as the breadth)
6. **Detail moved out** — `OPERATIONS.md` + `INSTALL.md` referenced
   as follow-up docs (TODOs); the 862-line legacy README is preserved
   at `lib/marketing/README-LEGACY-2026-06-26.md` as source material
   for those follow-ups
7. **Tone: middle** — academic credibility + value-forward hook;
   no marketing fluff (no "revolutionary," "next-generation,"
   "AI-powered" — every faculty BS-detector would catch those)

**What stayed from the old README** (rewritten, not removed):
title + badges, capability framing, FERPA story, license. The voice
is recognizably canvas-toolbox.

**What's new**: the wedge positioning, the safety-gate trust table,
the cross-faculty sharing prominent section, the comparison table
vs AI-grading-as-a-service, the synthetic terminal-output demo.

**Two reference artifacts created:**

1. **[lib/marketing/README-LEGACY-2026-06-26.md](lib/marketing/README-LEGACY-2026-06-26.md)** —
   the 862-line predecessor, preserved as source material for the
   `OPERATIONS.md` / `INSTALL.md` extractions when those land
2. **[handoffs/2026-06-26_readme-marketing-research.md](handoffs/2026-06-26_readme-marketing-research.md)** —
   gitignored audit-trail synthesis: the 6 repo analyses,
   7 cross-cutting patterns, recommended structure, the wedge story
   made concrete

**Follow-up work parked** (not blocking v0.68.0 ship):

- `OPERATIONS.md` — extract the audit-tool catalog detail from the
  legacy README
- `INSTALL.md` — extract the Step 1/2/3 IDE+AI-assistant detail
- Operator review pass on the rendered GH README (the operator
  said: "I will review it in GH rendered and come back with any
  tweaks")

**Cross-walk with parking-lot positioning work:**

The instructor-author vs AI-author wedge from the 2026-06-24
meeting (captured in `handoffs/parkinglot.md`) is now the README's
opening promise. The wedge moved from "captured for future
positioning work" to "live on the README." LinkedIn-marketing copy
(parking-lot idea C) can now draw verbatim from the README hook +
comparison table + safety-gate stack.

The cumulative session-arc since 2026-06-24 (~3 days):

| Day | Versions | Theme |
|---|---|---|
| 06-24 | v0.59.0 → v0.62.1 | Push-side safety gates (#95-#98) |
| 06-25 | v0.63.0 → v0.66.0 | Silent-success gates + group workflow + research-grounded knowledge files (#99/#101/#102/#100/#103) |
| 06-26 | v0.67.0 → v0.68.0 | Cross-faculty sharing + voice coaching ships + marketing pass |

**11 versions, 11 closed issues, 2 parking-lot ideas shipped, +178 tests in 3 days.** All lived-experience-driven or operator-research-grounded. Zero speculative.

## [0.67.1] — 2026-06-26

**README mentions cross-faculty sharing — Phase 1 of marketing pass**

**v0.67.1** — small docs-only patch. The v0.67.0 cross-faculty
sharing feature (grader_export.py + grader_import.py) wasn't
mentioned in the README; this patch adds a bullet to the "What you
can do with it" list naming the feature + the voice-preservation
guarantee + the FERPA exclusions + the version-compatibility refuse.

**Phase 1 of the larger marketing-perspective README pass** (operator
ask 2026-06-26). Phase 2 is the full marketing-shaped README rewrite
with research-grounded structure pulled from top-starred GH repos —
deferred to a separate work block per the established
research-synthesis-first pattern (same shape as the v0.65.0 voice
coaching deliverable).

## [0.67.0] — 2026-06-26

**cross-faculty sharing — grader_export.py + grader_import.py**

**v0.67.0** — ships parking-lot **Idea B (cross-section sharing)** as
formalized adoption-multiplier infrastructure. Faculty A teaching
Course X can now bundle their rubrics + task specs + configs into a
share.zip; Faculty B teaching the same course imports it as their
starting substrate. Per the voice-preservation contract from
v0.65.0: **the sending faculty's per-instructor voice file is NEVER
in the export.** The receiver builds their own voice.

**Operator decisions baked in** (locked during the 2026-06-26 scoping
pass):

| # | Decision | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tool shape | Pair of scripts (`grader_export.py` + `grader_import.py`) — matches the established naming convention |
| 2 | Export granularity | Operator passes `--challenges` list; default = all subdirectories of `grading/`. Supports both per-challenge and whole-course sharing scenarios |
| 3 | Voice handling | Per-instructor voice file NEVER exported. NEW course-level `voice_pitfalls.md` convention introduced (per-challenge optional file capturing course-content common mistakes, NOT voice). Universal pitfalls stay in `grader_voice_knowledge.md §5` (ships natively with canvas-toolbox; no need to bundle) |
| 4 | Version compatibility | Hard refuse if local canvas-toolbox is OLDER than the export's. Error message names the exact upgrade commands. Same-or-newer is fine |

**What landed:**

1. **[lib/tools/grader_export.py](lib/tools/grader_export.py)** —
   bundles a course's shareable artifacts into a ZIP. Whitelist:
   `RUBRIC.md`, `assignment_spec.md`, `voice_pitfalls.md`,
   `config.json`/`config.yml`/`config.yaml`, `README.md` per challenge.
   Defense-in-depth FERPA blacklist enforced (refuses to write any
   path matching `submissions_*`, `feedback/`, `.keymap.json`,
   `.fetch_log.json`, `.review.csv*`, `.push_log.md`,
   `_existing_grades.csv`, `_consensus.csv`, `_summary.csv`,
   `_all_comments.md`, `_gradebook_actuals.csv`,
   `UNIQUE_GROUP_MEMOS.md`, `student_feedback_voice_*`, `_corpus`).
   Writes `share-manifest.yml` + `READ_ME_BEFORE_IMPORT.md` at the
   ZIP root.
2. **[lib/tools/grader_import.py](lib/tools/grader_import.py)** —
   reads + validates the manifest, runs the version compatibility
   check (HARD REFUSE if local < export), shows the receiver exactly
   what's about to land + what's intentionally excluded, prompts
   `Type 'import' to confirm`, then extracts. Defense-in-depth
   blacklist enforced again on the receiving side.
3. **NEW `voice_pitfalls.md` convention** documented in
   [`grader_voice_knowledge.md §5`](lib/agents/knowledge/grader_voice_knowledge.md) —
   optional per-challenge file capturing course-level common mistakes
   (e.g., "in this Polars course, students confuse `top_k` and
   `head`; always redirect to `top_k`"). EXPORTED with the share
   bundle; distinct from the per-instructor voice file which is
   NEVER exported.
4. **[`grader_knowledge.md §17`](lib/agents/knowledge/grader_knowledge.md)** —
   new section "Cross-faculty sharing: export/import the course
   substrate, never the voice." Documents the two tools, the
   inclusion/exclusion lists, version compatibility, and the
   receiver's next-steps. The receiver README echo: *"Your voice is
   the asset. The imported substrate is a starting point."*
5. **38 new tests** in `test_grader_share_helpers.py` covering:
   - Defense-in-depth blacklist (submissions, feedback, identity
     bridges, reviewer/push artifacts, per-cohort grading data,
     per-instructor voice files, TA corpora, group memos, case
     insensitivity, false-positive guard on whitelisted files)
   - File-whitelist behavior (rubric/spec/config/voice_pitfalls
     inclusion; subdirectory recursion EXCLUDED to keep FERPA-
     protected per-student dirs invisible; deterministic sort;
     empty/nonexistent dirs safe)
   - Manifest building (required fields, voice-preservation named
     explicitly in exclusion list, challenge sorting determinism)
   - Receiver README rendering (course label named, voice
     preservation emphasized, numbered next-steps)
   - Semver parsing (basic, build metadata stripped, prerelease
     stripped, unparseable → None)
   - Version compatibility (same OK, newer OK, older REFUSED with
     versions named, unparseable proceeds with warning)
   - Manifest validation (minimal-ok, missing required fields,
     wrong types, defensive against garbage YAML)

**Total tests now 439 (up from 401).** All pre-commit hooks pass.

**Cross-issue + parking-lot composition.** This v0.67.0 release is
the cross-faculty adoption multiplier the parking-lot positioning
work has been pointing at:

- Idea **A** (voicing coach, v0.65.0) — receiver runs the articulation
  interview to build their own voice
- Idea **B** (cross-section sharing, v0.67.0 — THIS RELEASE) — sharing
  tool that preserves voice while transferring everything else
- Idea **C** (LinkedIn / adoption) — now provable: "AI-assisted
  grading where the instructor stays the author" has receiving-end
  enforcement, not just sending-end policy
- Idea **D** (robust nemawashi) — `voice_pitfalls.md` is one of the
  share-back mechanisms; cross-faculty sharing is the other

**The voice-preservation contract is now provable, not just
documented.** Two faculty teaching the same course can share rubrics
and task specs and course-content pitfalls — and the receiving
faculty's grading sounds like THEM, not like the sending faculty.
That's the architectural commitment from v0.65.0 made operational
in v0.67.0.

**Cross-repo:** DS 250 + DS 460 + CE 162 inherit the tools on next
pull. The first real-world use case is likely a future
multi-instructor BYUI offering (DS 250 next semester with a
different instructor; CE 162 picking up an additional section, etc.).
The pattern is also the most credible LinkedIn-ready feature for
the broader adoption story.

## [0.66.0] — 2026-06-25

**grader_fetch pulls latest attempt by default — issue #103**

**v0.66.0** — closes issue #103. **High-severity bug:** before this
fix, `grader_fetch.py` skipped re-downloading when a file of the same
filename already existed locally. Canvas filenames are stable across
attempts → student resubmits → toolkit silently kept stale attempt-1
file → operator graded stale content → 3 DS 250 students were pushed
"still needs revision" comments while they had actually fixed and
resubmitted. The worst failure mode.

**Root cause:** the skip decision was by filename existence, not
attempt freshness. Nothing compared the local file to the remote
submission's `attempt` / `submitted_at`.

**The fix (default behavior change — strictly more correct):**

1. **New pure helper `needs_refetch(local_exists, recorded_attempt,
   remote_attempt, recorded_submitted_at, remote_submitted_at)`** in
   [grader_fetch.py:399-456](lib/tools/grader_fetch.py#L399-L456).
   Returns True when there's positive evidence the remote is newer.
   Defensive across None/missing/non-numeric values — partial data
   never CAUSES a refetch and never PREVENTS one.

2. **`.fetch_log.json` entry schema extended** to record `attempt` +
   `submitted_at` per file (default path + quiz path) and
   `latest_activity_at` per user (discussion path). Old logs without
   these fields still readable — `needs_refetch` falls back to local-
   exists semantics when prior signals are missing.

3. **All three fetch paths wired** (discussion / quiz / default). The
   default path covers attachments + online_text_entry + online_url
   sub-branches. Discussion path uses the max `created_at`/`updated_at`
   across the user's entries (discussions have no attempt# concept).

4. **`--force` semantics unchanged** — still "re-download everything
   regardless." The new default only re-pulls when remote is genuinely
   newer (cheap and correct).

5. **Visibility** — refetched rows print `(refetched: attempt N → N+1)`
   so the operator sees what changed. For discussion-path refetches,
   `(refetched: discussion updated)`.

6. **11 new tests** in `test_grader_fetch_helpers.py` covering the
   `needs_refetch` decision matrix (local missing → fetch; remote
   attempt newer → fetch; remote submitted_at newer → fetch; same
   attempt → skip; same submitted_at → skip; attempt-disagreement-
   with-timestamp → attempt wins; no recorded data + local exists →
   skip / don't speculatively refetch; non-numeric attempts safely
   ignored; partial signals don't trigger false refetch; empty-string
   timestamps treated as missing; remote attempt older → no refetch).

7. **[grader_knowledge.md §10](lib/agents/knowledge/grader_knowledge.md)** —
   added pull-latest-by-default subsection paired with the v0.60.0
   regression-gate story. Names the two layers explicitly: upstream
   (#103) ensures the local file IS the latest attempt; downstream
   (#96) ensures the push doesn't accidentally lower a grade. They
   compose: the grade reaching Canvas was computed from the LATEST
   submission AND won't accidentally drop below what the student
   already had.

**Total tests now 401 (up from 390).** All pre-commit hooks pass.

**Cross-issue thread.** This is the 4th lived-experience-driven
grading-safety fix from DS 250 this week (#95 / #96 / #97 / #98 / #99
/ #101 / #102 from yesterday + today's earlier batch, now #103).
Pattern continues: bug-intake-worker → GH issue → lived RCA →
shipped fix → cohort inherits on pull.

**Cross-repo:** DS 250 + DS 460 + CE 162 inherit on next pull. The
new behavior is strictly more correct than the old; operators who
were relying on `--force` to handle resubmissions will see them
detected automatically going forward.

## [0.65.0] — 2026-06-25

**voice_coaching_knowledge.md — upstream scaffolding for the per-instructor voice file**

**v0.65.0** — first knowledge file produced under canvas-toolbox's
research-grounded path (Option C from the planning conversation:
research synthesis doc + draft knowledge file, both committed to
audit-trail). Closes parking-lot idea A (voicing coach) from the
2026-06-24 meeting.

**Operator-set constraint:** preserve the faculty's voice; add value
through phrasing while keeping the voicing intact. Apply the 80/20
rule. This constraint reshaped the entire deliverable — instead of a
"here's how to give better feedback" file that would have flattened
faculty into a generic best-practices yardstick, the file separates
WHAT (universal effectiveness — checkable; agent-applied) from HOW
(per-instructor voice — preserved; agent-respected).

**What landed:**

1. **[lib/agents/knowledge/voice_coaching_knowledge.md](lib/agents/knowledge/voice_coaching_knowledge.md)**
   (~3,900 words) — the v1.0 shippable artifact. 8 sections:
   - §1 — The WHAT/HOW split, named explicitly
   - §2 — The WHAT: 4-point universal effectiveness check (Hattie
     three questions + cognitive-load 1-2 priority items)
   - §3 — The HOW: 8 voice dimensions with synthetic worked
     examples ("same WHAT, different HOWs")
   - §4 — The 80/20 boundary made visible
   - §5 — First-time voice articulation interview (5 questions, ~30
     min, produces a starter `student_feedback_voice_<instructor>.md`)
   - §6 — Edge cases: surface-don't-override pattern when voice and
     effectiveness conflict
   - §7 — Cross-walk to existing voice infrastructure
   - §8 — Research citations
2. **handoffs/2026-06-25_voice-coaching-research.md** (~3,900 words,
   gitignored) — the audit-trail research synthesis. 8 frameworks
   analyzed, DS 250 + DS 460 voice artifacts compared, decisions
   that shaped the knowledge file documented. Available locally for
   anyone who wants to see WHY each section is structured as it is.
3. **[lib/agents/knowledge/README.md](lib/agents/knowledge/README.md)** —
   updated routing table + new "The files" entry following the
   established pattern.

**The research foundation** (8 frameworks):

- **Hattie & Timperley (2007)** — three feedback questions (Where am
  I? How am I? Where to next?). The spine.
- **Wiggins (2012)** — seven keys: goal-referenced, tangible,
  actionable, user-friendly, timely, ongoing, consistent.
- **Dweck (1998-ongoing)** — process vs ability praise. Treated as a
  DIMENSION (not a rule) per operator preference — "nothing should be
  'hard' or 'rules'."
- **Brookhart (2008/2017)** — content + strategy element framework.
- **Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller 1988-ongoing)** — working memory
  limits → 1-2 priority items rule.
- **Warm-demander pedagogy (Hammond 2014; Delpit; Kleinfeld)** —
  high expectations + high warmth + culturally-grounded.
- **Black & Wiliam (1998/2009)** — closing-the-gap formative
  feedback. Almost identical to Hattie three; reinforces the spine.
- **AI voice preservation literature (2025-2026)** — voice fidelity
  is THE adoption barrier; teacher-as-collaborator framing.

**DS 250 + DS 460 cross-course voice signature** (extracted via
Explore-agent mapping of both repos):

- "To be unclear is to be unkind" — appears in BOTH repos as a core
  value (Chaz Clark's voice signature)
- Anti-meta-scaffolding ("Cut 'I want to be clear...'") in BOTH
- "These students are adults" / "consulting engagement" — peer-
  professional register in BOTH
- Forward-looking + concise + specific-praise-only — consistent
  across both courses

The coaching file uses synthetic worked examples (not corpus
extracts) per operator preference — "synthetic + label ok" — to
avoid biasing toward Chaz's voice as "the example."

**Operator decisions baked into the file** (from the scoping pass):

| Question | Operator answer | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Worked examples shape | Synthetic + labeled | §3 examples are clearly marked synthetic |
| Dweck framing | Dimension, not rule | Axis 6 treats process/ability as a position |
| Override behavior on edge cases | Never unilateral | §6 "surface, don't override" |
| Edits to existing voice file? | No — standalone | `grader_voice_knowledge.md` unchanged |
| Length | OK at ~3,900 words | Kept as drafted |

**What's NOT in scope:**

- Edits to `grader_voice_knowledge.md` — kept standalone per operator
  decision (avoid bloat)
- Companion JSON file — the knowledge file is markdown-only for v1.0;
  if downstream tools need structured access, that's a follow-up
- Sample-feedback corpus extracts in examples — synthetic per
  operator preference
- Automated WHAT-check validation tool — knowledge file is reference;
  the agent applies the 4-point check on each draft comment

**Cross-repo implication:** DS 250, DS 460, CE 162 (and any future
adopter) inherit the coaching file on next pull. The file is
particularly valuable for first-time instructors who don't yet have
a per-instructor voice file the existing edit roundtrip can refine
— Section 5's articulation interview produces a starter voice file in
~30 minutes.

**Pairs with the broader marketing positioning** (parking lot —
"AI-assisted grading where the instructor stays the author, not the
AI"). The voice-preservation contract in §1 is the architectural
proof that this positioning is real, not just rhetoric.

## [0.64.0] — 2026-06-25

**first-class Canvas group-assignment workflow — issue #100**

**v0.64.0** — closes issue #100. First non-DS-250/DS-460 issue this
session — filed from **CE 162 Land Surveying (BYUI)**, a different
course/instructor adopting the toolkit. The course had a real
multi-tool workaround for Canvas group assignments (lab memos, one
per group, but Canvas creates per-member submission rows that
duplicate the content); they wanted first-class support upstream
rather than carrying the workaround forward per cohort.

**Three-phase implementation across three tools, plus knowledge:**

**Phase A — `grader_fetch.py`** detects group context, fetches groups
+ members, writes two new artifacts. New pure helpers:
`is_group_assignment(asg_meta)`, `grades_individually(asg_meta)`,
`build_group_map(groups, members_by_group)`,
`pick_group_representatives(group_map, submitter_uids)`,
`render_unique_group_memos_md(...)`,
`group_context_for_fetch_log(...)`. New Canvas API helpers:
`fetch_group_category_groups`, `fetch_group_members`. Wired into all
three sub-paths (discussion / quiz / default).

Artifacts (both FERPA-safe — user_ids + group_ids, no names):
- `<challenge-dir>/UNIQUE_GROUP_MEMOS.md` — human-readable per-group
  listing (representative submitter / mirrored members /
  non-submitters / groups without submissions). Agent reads this
  BEFORE grading.
- `.fetch_log.json` `"group_context"` block — JSON
  user_id → {group_id, group_name, member_user_ids} mapping.
  Consumed by reidentify + push.

**Phase B — `grader_reidentify.py`** mirrors the rep's score + reason
+ feedback file to mirrored group-member rows in `.review.csv`. New
pure helpers: `build_user_to_keys(keymap)`,
`pick_group_representatives_from_context(...)`,
`mirror_group_rows(...)`. New column on `.review.csv`:
`group_mirror_of` (empty for non-mirror rows; rep_key for mirrors).

**Phase C — `grader_push.py`** drops mirrored rows from the push plan
in shared-grade mode (Canvas distributes the rep's grade via
`comment[group_comment]=true`); preserves them in individual-grade
mode. Operator can override per-row by setting `final_grade` on a
mirrored row — kept as an explicit individual push. New pure
helpers: `is_group_mirror_row(row)`,
`filter_group_mirror_rows(rows, group_context)`.

**Phase D — knowledge**. New "Group assignments — grade one
representative per group" subsection in `grader_knowledge.md §10`.
Three-artifact table + two-mode behavior + agent Standard Work for
the group grading flow + operator override rule.

**`.gitignore`** adds `**/UNIQUE_GROUP_MEMOS.md` for consistency
with the other per-challenge artifacts.

**46 new tests** across three test files:
- `test_grader_fetch_helpers.py` +21 (group detection, group_map
  building, rep picking, MEMOS rendering, fetch_log context shape)
- `test_grader_reidentify_helpers.py` +15 (NEW FILE — `build_user_to_keys`,
  `pick_reps_from_context`, `mirror_group_rows` with mirror /
  override / multi-group / missing-rep-feedback edge cases)
- `test_grader_push_helpers.py` +10 (is_group_mirror_row +
  filter_group_mirror_rows behavior across shared / individual /
  operator-override modes)

Total tests 390 (up from 344).

**The lived failure the workaround surfaced (and why upstream
support matters).** Without group support, an instructor grading a
7-group × 3-members-each assignment had to either:
- (a) Hand-edit the CSV to dedupe rows + manually copy feedback
  files across mirrors (the CE 162 workaround), OR
- (b) Accept that the agent would re-grade 21 identical
  submissions independently and risk inconsistent grades/comments
  across members of the same group

Both are real cohort-level grading failures. The first-class
workflow eliminates both: agent grades the 7 representatives;
mirror logic propagates to the 14 group-mates; push collapses to
7 PUTs (each with `group_comment=true`) instead of 21.

**Cross-repo adoption signal.** CE 162 filed the issue with a
fully-worked local solution (their `UNIQUE_GROUP_MEMOS.md`
prototype) AND specific advice on which Canvas API endpoints to hit
+ which fields matter. That's mature adopter behavior — they're
running canvas-toolbox in production on Windows and shipping
contributions back. Worth surfacing for the LinkedIn marketing
story (parking-lot positioning section): "first non-DS-cohort
contribution arrived 2026-06-24."

## [0.63.0] — 2026-06-25

**three paired "silent-success looks like success" gates — issues #99 / #101 / #102**

**v0.63.0** — closes three DS 250 issues filed yesterday afternoon /
this morning, all surfacing the same failure pattern: **the tool
reports a green signal that conceals a systematic error.** Different
seams, same lesson — make the tool fail loudly when the underlying
assumption is unsafe.

| Issue | Failure mode | Coded gate |
|---|---|---|
| **#99** | Operator blanks `final_grade` to hold a row; `recommended_score` fallback fires; sentinel `(held)` gets coerced by Canvas to incomplete/score=0 on pass_fail; a student's COMPLETE silently became FAIL | New pure helper `validate_grade_for_grading_type` refuses sentinels + invalid grades pre-PUT, surfaces clearly per row, counts in summary line |
| **#101** | Solution-derived rubric required an OPTIONAL chart; 3/3 grader passes unanimous (spread 0.00); 4 students wrongly marked incomplete; consensus output read as "high confidence" because spread stats measure inter-grader consistency, not rubric correctness | New pure helper `detect_calibration_anchor` + prominent UNCALIBRATED-COHORT warning that inverts the spread framing on uncalibrated runs; `--uncalibrated` flag for soft acknowledgment |
| **#102** | Rubric inherited a requirement from the answer key that the task page explicitly called OPTIONAL — same DS 250 U4T3 incident as #101, input side | New `assignment_spec.md` artifact written by `grader_fetch.py` capturing the Canvas description + the linked course-site task page text; agent reads it BEFORE grading; knowledge files codify "task page = source of truth, answer key = reference" |

**The cross-issue thread.** Yesterday's #95/#96/#97 sprint was
"documented-but-unenforced gates." Today's #99/#101/#102 sprint is the
companion thread:

> **"The gate's signal looks like success but is silently wrong."**

#99 — sentinel LOOKS pushed; coerced silently. #101 — consensus LOOKS
confident; rubric was wrong. #102 — Canvas description LOOKS like the
spec; it's just a pointer.

Together: 6 production safety gates shipped across 24 hours (v0.59.0
→ v0.63.0). All bug-intake-worker driven (issues #95-#98 + #99 + #101
+ #102). 100% lived-experience scope; zero speculative.

**Code shape:**

1. **[grader_push.py:181-264](lib/tools/grader_push.py#L181-L264)**:
   new `validate_grade_for_grading_type(grade, grading_type)` returning
   `'ok' / 'sentinel' / 'invalid' / 'not_graded' / 'unknown_type'`.
   Recognizes parenthesized sentinels (`(held)`, `(not graded)`,
   `(skip)`), bare keywords (`held`, `n/a`, `tbd`, `pending`), and
   validates against `grading_type` (`pass_fail`, `points`, `percent`,
   `gpa_scale`, `letter_grade`, `not_graded`).
2. **`fetch_assignment_lock_state` extended** to return `grading_type`
   from the same `/assignments/:aid` call (no extra API round-trip).
3. **[grader_consensus.py:81-130](lib/tools/grader_consensus.py#L81-L130)**:
   new `detect_calibration_anchor(challenge_dir, feedback_dir)`
   scanning for `ta_grades*.json/csv` + `_groundtruth.json/csv`.
   Warning header is prominent (78-char banner) on uncalibrated runs;
   consistency-stats footer adds the "consistency ≠ correctness" line
   on uncalibrated cohorts.
4. **[grader_fetch.py](lib/tools/grader_fetch.py)**: new
   `extract_task_page_url(canvas_description_html)` +
   `fetch_task_page_text(url)` + `render_assignment_spec(...)` +
   `write_assignment_spec_md(...)`. Wired into `main()` right after
   `fetch_assignment_metadata` — runs once per fetch, covers all three
   sub-paths (discussion / quiz / default).
5. **Knowledge file updates:**
   - [grader_knowledge.md §10](lib/agents/knowledge/grader_knowledge.md):
     new "Standard Work — task page = source of truth" subsection.
     Three-artifact discipline table (task page / answer key / rubric)
     + the OPTIONAL-by-default rule + the diagnostic for rubric
     requirements under review.
   - [grader_setup_knowledge.md §Step 2](lib/agents/knowledge/grader_setup_knowledge.md):
     new "Precondition for ALL three paths — task spec is source of
     truth" sub-section. Applies to rubric-construction in Path C +
     rubric-validation in Paths A and B.
6. **37 new tests** across `test_grader_push_helpers.py` (+15
   `validate_grade_for_grading_type` cases), new
   `test_grader_consensus_helpers.py` (9 `detect_calibration_anchor`
   cases), and `test_grader_fetch_helpers.py` (+13 `extract_task_page_url`
   + `render_assignment_spec` cases). Total tests now 338 (up from
   307).
7. **`.gitignore`** adds `**/assignment_spec.md` for consistency with
   the other per-challenge artifacts.

**What's NOT in scope** (deferred for follow-up if DS 250 surfaces
need): the automated rubric-vs-spec mismatch check. The spec capture
+ knowledge update is the actionable lever; the automated check is a
backstop that can land later if the human-readable spec doesn't
catch the same class of error.

**Cross-issue cumulative guarantee (now 6 gates strong):**

> The grade reaching Canvas is **consensus-backed** (#95), **never
> accidentally lower than what the student already had** (#96), **never
> pushed without explicit human review** (#97), **uses the
> de-identified comment thread for triage** (#98), **passes
> grading-type validation** (#99), **fails loudly on uncalibrated
> unanimity** (#101), and **is graded against the student-facing task
> spec, not the answer key** (#102).

## [0.62.1] — 2026-06-24

**--skip-if-student-replied surfaces the de-id'd latest comment inline — issue #98**

**v0.62.1** — small DS 250 quality-of-life enhancement. Closes
issue #98. Filed from `ds250-onln-master/canvas-toolbox` (W08 Joins
push held 6 rows; all benign "I resubmitted" replies that required
a separate `grader_deidentify_comments.py` pass to confirm).

**The gap:** the `--skip-if-student-replied` skip-print used only
the key — operator had to run a second tool to read each held
thread and decide whether the student's reply was benign ("I fixed
it / re-uploaded") vs. an open question (still needs a response).
The deid'd latest comment was already in hand from the #62
collision-guard pipeline; the skip-print just discarded it.

**The fix (display-only, no behavior change):**

1. New pure helper **[`truncate_comment_preview(text, limit=240)`](lib/tools/grader_push.py)**
   — one-line preview with newline collapse + ellipsize past `limit`.
2. **`student_replied_keys: set` → `student_replied_latest: dict`**
   — same gate behavior, but the dict carries the deid'd latest
   comment alongside the key.
3. **Skip-print updated** to surface `[KEY] role=self <created_at>:
   "<scrubbed comment>"`. The comment text is already FERPA-scrubbed
   (issue #65 collision-guard deid pipeline produced it).
4. **6 new tests** in
   [test_grader_push_helpers.py](lib/tests/test_grader_push_helpers.py)
   — short text passthrough, newline collapse, CRLF normalization,
   truncation past limit, default-240-char limit, None/empty
   handling.

**FERPA note:** no new surface. The same `deidentify_submission_comments`
pipeline that produces the scrubbed text for the collision-guard
print produces it here. This change wires the in-hand data through
to the skip-print; it does NOT fetch or process anything new.

**Operator UX:** one-pass triage of held rows. Benign resubmission
replies vs. open questions become visible in the same output instead
of requiring a second tool invocation per push.

## [0.62.0] — 2026-06-24

**--mark-reviewed --yes refused on LLM-comment path — issue #97**

**v0.62.0** — closes issue #97 ("enforce the human-in-the-middle
review gate before push"). Lived (DS 460): a grading agent ran
`grade` → `--mark-reviewed --yes` → `--push` in one motion under
"grade these late ones now" pressure. The grades were sound, but
the human-in-the-middle review of `_all_comments.md` never happened.
Instructor caught it after the push. The grades being correct
doesn't redeem the gate being skipped — the next batch might not be.

**Investigation finding:** the `.reviewed` marker requirement was
already in place ([grader_push.py:1192-1217](lib/tools/grader_push.py#L1192-L1217))
— `--push` refuses without it, auto-invalidates on review-surface
mtime changes. Fix 1 of the issue was a duplicate. The REAL gap
was the `--yes` shortcut: an agent could pass it with
`--mark-reviewed` to bypass the "Type 'reviewed' to confirm" prompt
and self-attest the review. That's the hole.

**The fix:**

1. **New pure helper `is_yes_refused_on_review(comment_files, yes_flag)`**
   in [grader_push.py:181-198](lib/tools/grader_push.py#L181-L198) —
   returns True when the caller should refuse. Path-aware: refuses
   only on the LLM-comment sub-path (where `prefix-*.md` files
   exist); allows on the value-only / human-graded path (human IS
   the grader; `--yes` there is a script convenience).
2. **Refusal wired into `--mark-reviewed`** with a clear error
   message: "An agent can pass --yes; a human must physically type
   'reviewed' to attest review of `_all_comments.md`."
3. **`--yes` help text updated** to mention the carve-out so
   `--help` discovery surfaces the rule.
4. **[grader_knowledge.md §10](lib/agents/knowledge/grader_knowledge.md)**
   — new Standard Work subsection codifying the agent-side rule:
   "grade X" produces the review artifact and STOPS; pushing is a
   SEPARATE explicitly human-approved step; the agent never chains
   grade→push under "do it now" pressure; the agent never passes
   `--yes` to `--mark-reviewed`. The tool refusal is the safety net;
   the agent's protocol-level rule is the first line of defense.
5. **4 new tests** in [test_grader_push_helpers.py](lib/tests/test_grader_push_helpers.py)
   covering the predicate (comment-files-present + --yes refused;
   value-only + --yes allowed; no --yes always allowed; refusal
   independent of file count).

**The cross-issue pattern (#95 / #96 / #97).** Three
documented-but-unenforced protocols each failed under operator-busy
pressure. v0.59.0–v0.62.0 converts each from prose policy into a
coded precondition:

| Issue | Failure mode | Coded gate |
|---|---|---|
| #95 | Single pass ships without consensus | `_consensus.csv` presence + freshness gate at `--mark-reviewed` |
| #96 | Re-grade silently lowers existing grade | Regression direction gate at PUT seam + upstream `_existing_grades.csv` |
| #97 | Agent self-attests review with `--yes` | `--yes` refused on LLM-comment review path |

Together the guarantee: the grade reaching Canvas is **consensus-backed,
never accidentally lower than what the student already had, and
never pushed without explicit human review.**

## [0.61.0] — 2026-06-24

**grader_fetch surfaces existing Canvas grades for re-grade detection — issue #96 part 3**

**v0.61.0** — completes the upstream half of issue #96. The
downstream push-side regression gate (v0.60.0) is the SAFETY NET; this
release adds the UPSTREAM PREVENTATIVE so the agent recognizes a
re-grade BEFORE doing the work of grading cold.

**The artifact:** `<challenge-dir>/_existing_grades.csv` (gitignored,
FERPA-safe — opaque key only, no PII):

```csv
key,existing_grade,existing_score,workflow_state
KC1-A1B2C3,3.75,3.75,graded
KC1-D4E5F6,B+,87.0,graded
KC1-G7H8I9,complete,100.0,graded
```

- **Keyed by the same opaque SHA-256 key** the agent sees later via
  `key_for(filename, prefix)`. Imported from
  `grader_deidentify_databricks` to guarantee derivation parity.
- **Filtered to `workflow_state == "graded"`** — only existing prior
  grades surface (per operator preference; non-graded states absent
  until a use case demands otherwise).
- **Always written** — header-only file = fresh cohort with no prior
  grades. Presence of file = fetch completed.

**Two pure helpers** in [grader_fetch.py](lib/tools/grader_fetch.py):

- `existing_grades_rows(raw_dir, subs, prefix)` — walks raw_dir,
  joins each `<prefix>_<uid>.<ext>` filename to the matching
  submission by uid, filters to graded, derives keys via `key_for`.
- `write_existing_grades_csv(challenge_dir, rows)` — header-stable
  emit; overwrites on re-run so stale data can't mislead the agent.

**Wired into all three fetch paths** (discussion / quiz / default
attachment). The discussion path didn't previously call
`fetch_submissions`; one extra API call surfaces the grade + score +
state. Quiz + default paths reuse the `subs` already in scope.

**[grader_knowledge.md §10](lib/agents/knowledge/grader_knowledge.md)**
— new "Re-grade detection — consult `_existing_grades.csv` before
assigning a score" subsection. Codifies the Standard Work:

1. Look up the key in `_existing_grades.csv` before scoring.
2. If `existing_grade` non-empty → RE-GRADE. Apply re-grade rules:
   anchor to existing, surface explicitly in reason column, NEVER
   silently lower.
3. Consensus still runs; high spread on a re-grade lands in
   NEEDS-REVIEW.

The push-side regression gate from v0.60.0 remains the final safety
net (refuses to LOWER without `--allow-lower`), but the upstream
surface means the conflict, when it exists, is visible from the
first pass rather than emerging at push time.

**12 new tests** in [test_grader_fetch_helpers.py](lib/tests/test_grader_fetch_helpers.py)
covering filter-to-graded, key-derivation parity with `key_for`,
None handling, stale-prefix skipping, missing-submission skipping,
empty-dir behavior, multi-attachment suffix support, letter-grade +
pass-fail value preservation, header-only emit, full row emit,
overwrite semantics.

**Open next:** issue #97 (review-gate enforcement). Investigation
confirmed fix 1 of the issue is already in place
([grader_push.py:1171-1204](lib/tools/grader_push.py#L1171-L1204) —
the `.reviewed` marker is required for `--push` and auto-invalidates
on review-surface changes). The real gap is: `--mark-reviewed --yes`
on the LLM-comment sub-path bypasses the interactive "Type
'reviewed' to confirm" prompt. The fix is one conditional refusing
`--yes` on that sub-path + an agent-knowledge update saying "grade X"
stops at `_all_comments.md` and never auto-pushes. Scoped as v0.62.0.

## [0.60.0] — 2026-06-24

**grader_push refuses to silently LOWER an existing grade — issue #96**

**v0.60.0** — closes issue #96 ("grader_push must never silently
lower an existing grade"). Lived (DS 460): an out-of-band Slack drop
was treated as an initial submission and graded fresh. Student was
already graded 3.75 in an earlier run; local `submissions_raw/` was
empty for that uid so the existing local-file re-submission check
passed. The fresh re-grade (3.5) was about to ship — caught only
because an ad-hoc print showed `before → after`. Silent grade
regression is the highest-stakes failure mode in grading.

**Three layers of fix in the push seam:**

1. **[grader_push.py](lib/tools/grader_push.py) `normalize_grade` +
   `regression_check`** — new pure helpers that classify a grade as
   `numeric` / `letter` / `pass_fail` / `empty` / `unknown` and
   direction-compare existing vs new. Letter scale is full F → A+
   (F, D-, D, D+, C-, C, C+, B-, B, B+, A-, A, A+) with rank ordering.
   Pass/fail is `incomplete` < `complete` (case-insensitive).
2. **Push loop gate** — fetches each submission's current Canvas
   grade and refuses to LOWER it without `--allow-lower`. Class
   mismatches (numeric vs letter, etc.) and unknown grade strings
   refuse the push and surface for manual review — a grade we can't
   classify is a grade we can't direction-check.
3. **Visibility by default** — every row prints `pushed KEY:
   before → after`; every push-log line records `grade <before> →
   <after> pushed to assignment <aid>`. The blind-write failure
   mode is gone.

**New flag `--allow-lower`** — explicit, logged opt-out (for
legitimate cases like an academic-integrity reversal). Follows the
existing `--allow-*` convention. The bypass is logged inline per row
so the audit trail shows the intentional regrade.

**fetch_submissions extended** — the lean default response now
includes `grade` (display string) + `score` (numeric) per row in
addition to `user_id` + `id`. Cost: same single API call that was
already made; no extra round-trips.

**17 new tests** in [test_grader_push_helpers.py](lib/tests/test_grader_push_helpers.py)
— 7 for `normalize_grade` (empty / numeric / letter / case-insensitive
/ pass-fail / unknown strings / full F→A+ ordering chain) + 10 for
`regression_check` (first-fill / numeric lower-is-regression / raise-or-equal /
letter regression / letter raise / pass-fail regression / pass-fail
raise / class mismatch / unknown-class halt / new-empty mismatch).

**[grader_knowledge.md §10](lib/agents/knowledge/grader_knowledge.md)** —
new mechanism item #10 documenting the regression gate + updated
"Out-of-band drops and re-submissions" subsection with the lived
DS 460 failure as the motivating example.

**Out of scope (filed as follow-up):** issue #96 part 3 — pre-grade
check via `grader_fetch` surfacing "this user already has a Canvas
grade" to the agent BEFORE grading. The push-side gate is the
safety net that prevents the harm reaching Canvas; the pre-grade
check is upstream preventative work. Recommend file as separate
issue when ready.

## [0.59.0] — 2026-06-24

**3-pass consensus is now enforced at the push seam — issue #95**

**v0.59.0** — closes issue #95 ("make 3-grader consensus the default
with a hard opt-out"). Lived (DS 460 Key-Challenge batch): a single
grader pass nearly shipped because the keyless agent collapsed to 1
pass under parallel-grading pressure. When the 3-pass consensus was
retroactively run, **6 of 15 scores moved + 7 of 15 flagged
NEEDS-REVIEW**. The documented 3-pass protocol was advisory, not
enforced — exactly the failure mode the "doc-only protocols fail
when the operator is busy" lesson predicts.

**Root cause + fix:** the seams enforcement was incomplete. The
existing safeguards are good — `grader_consensus.py` already defaults
to `--expected 3` and halts on too-few graders; `grader_grade.py`
already has the `--single`/`--bulk`/`.calibrated` triad — but
`grader_push.py` had no gate. A keyless agent could write
`_grader1.csv` + per-student feedback files directly and push without
ever invoking consensus.

**What changed:**

1. **[grader_push.py:181-203](lib/tools/grader_push.py#L181-L203)** —
   new pure helper `consensus_gate_status(fbdir)` returns `'ok'`,
   `'missing'`, or `'stale'` based on `_consensus.csv` presence +
   mtime vs. the newest `_grader*.csv`.
2. **[grader_push.py](lib/tools/grader_push.py) `--mark-reviewed` path** —
   for LLM-graded runs (path with `prefix-*.md` files present), the
   gate refuses to write `.reviewed` (and therefore `--push` refuses
   in turn) unless `_consensus.csv` exists AND is fresh. Clear error
   message points at `grader_consensus.py`. The value-only /
   human-graded sub-path is unaffected (no graders → no gate).
3. **New flag `--allow-single-pass`** — explicit, logged opt-out.
   Follows the existing `--allow-collisions` / `--allow-enrolled` /
   `--allow-locked-resubmit` convention. Logs a warning when used so
   the bypass is visible in the operator's terminal.
4. **[grader_knowledge.md §4](lib/agents/knowledge/grader_knowledge.md)** —
   new "Standard Work — the 3-pass default is enforced, not advisory"
   subsection. Codifies: produce 3 passes by default on the keyless
   agent path; OFFER the 3-pass run before any LLM-graded batch and
   get explicit operator decline before single-pass; the seam check
   is the safety net, not the only line of defense.
5. **7 new tests** in [test_grader_push_helpers.py](lib/tests/test_grader_push_helpers.py) —
   missing / stale / fresh / equal-mtime / newest-mtime-of-many /
   no-graders edge cases.

**What's NOT in scope:** existing safeguards (consensus.py's
`--expected 3` halt; grader_grade.py's `.calibrated` marker; the
mechanism doc itself) are already correct and untouched. Surgical
change at the one seam that actually leaked.

**Cross-repo implication:** DS 460 + DS 250 + any future grader-fork
inherits this gate automatically on their next pull. Operators who
were running single-pass intentionally (calibration cohorts) need
`--allow-single-pass` — but the `--mark-calibrated` upstream gate
should mean those flows don't hit `--mark-reviewed` to begin with.

## [0.58.2] — 2026-06-23

**Cline added as Ollama alternative; Continue.dev still preferred**

**v0.58.2** — small README polish following v0.58.1. Operator wants
Cline listed alongside Continue.dev as a viable Ollama extension
("preferred is Continue.dev"; operator will personally test both).

Two README edits:
  1. The Ollama row in Step 2's matrix now reads "Continue.dev
     (preferred) — or Cline as an alternative." Both Marketplace
     URLs surfaced + the Ollama link stays.
  2. The 🦙 caveat note now covers both — Continue.dev framed as the
     safer first pick (Apache 2.0; broader adoption; more stable
     backend abstraction); Cline framed as newer-but-capable for the
     same agentic workflow. Both are local-first; both are open-source.

**Why both rather than just one:** the operator plans to personally
test each before locking the long-term recommendation. Documenting
both NOW protects future-me from re-deriving why the alternative was
considered + lets adopters who already prefer Cline see it's a
documented path.

**No code changes.** README + AGENTS.md + version triple update only.

## [0.58.1] — 2026-06-23

**Ollama + Continue.dev added to README Step 2**

**v0.58.1** — docs-only follow-up to v0.58.0. Operator flagged that the
README's "Pick your AI assistant" matrix only covered subscription-keyed
options (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) + the Antigravity / Gemini fallback.
Missing: local models for the FERPA-strict + cost-conscious adopter
cohort.

**Added a new row** to README Step 2 between Copilot and Antigravity:
  - **Local models (Ollama)** → **Continue.dev** (open-source, Apache 2.0,
    fully agentic VS Code extension)
  - No account; configure Ollama backend in Continue's settings
  - Links to both Continue Marketplace listing + ollama.com

**Added a 🦙 caveat note** explaining honestly:
  - What the path is (Continue.dev + Ollama, fully agentic — reads files,
    runs commands, edits code; same workflow as cloud extensions)
  - Why it's worth considering (local-first; nothing leaves the machine;
    FERPA-strict-friendly; no subscription cost)
  - The trade-off (today's local code models handle deterministic +
    structural work well but typically need extra calibration for nuanced
    prose grading vs Claude / GPT-4)
  - Concrete starting-point models (qwen2.5-coder, deepseek-coder-v2,
    codestral) without over-prescribing

**Why this matters strategically:** aligns with canvas-toolbox's standing
"brain-agnostic" philosophy + the deterministic-first grader principle
codified in v0.57.3. Local models excel at the deterministic-first
work (which is most of the grader pipeline) and only struggle with the
LLM-eval portion (the messy middle from grader_knowledge.md §16).
Adopters with FERPA constraints that prevent cloud LLM use now have
a documented path.

**No code changes; README-only patch.** All 261 tests still passing.
Triple-version-sync maintained (pyproject + plugin + marketplace all
0.58.0 → 0.58.1).

**Deeper integration deferred to a future trigger:** the `GraderLLM`
interface in `grader_grade.py` already abstracts the LLM provider
(today's only impl is `AnthropicGraderLLM`). An `OllamaGraderLLM`
subclass would plug in cleanly when an adopter actually uses the
keyholder path with local models. Not yet built; would land as a v0.X.Y
when an institutional signal arrives or the operator pulls it.

## [0.58.0] — 2026-06-22

**`course_homepage_build.py` v0.1 — DesignPLUS-free course home page**

**v0.58.0** — new tool surface. Triggered by: BYUI moving off DesignPLUS for
cost savings; operator was added to another instructor's course
with a DesignPLUS-themed home page; flagged it as worth
absorbing into canvas-toolbox knowledge AS an HTML/CSS-native replacement.

**What v0.1 ships:**
- `lib/tools/course_homepage_build.py` (~430 lines) — reads `schedule.yml` +
  today's date, renders a static HTML home page with the CURRENT week
  pre-expanded as a `<details open>`, others collapsed. Three modes:
  `--bootstrap-from-canvas` (generates a starter schedule.yml from a
  course's modules), default render (write HTML to file), `--apply`
  (PUT to Canvas /front_page, honors canvas_course_guard).
- `lib/agents/templates/course_homepage/schedule.example.yml` — documented
  schedule schema with all fields commented.
- `lib/agents/knowledge/course_homepage_knowledge.md` (~250 lines) —
  design rationale, when to use, accessibility notes, FERPA assessment
  (clean by construction — modules + dates aren't student data),
  decision tree for when NOT to use this, integration with other tools,
  anti-patterns to refuse if instructors ask.
- `lib/tests/test_course_homepage_build.py` — 33 pure-logic tests
  covering date parsing, schedule validation, current-week selection,
  module-URL building, render output shape (incl. no-JS guarantee,
  no-external-stylesheet guarantee, current-week-marking).

**The model is pure-CSS + scheduled regenerate:**
- No JavaScript in the rendered page (Canvas-WYSIWYG-safe; no
  DesignPLUS account-level injection required)
- Pure-CSS techniques: anchor-jump nav links + native `<details>/<summary>`
  accordions + `<details open>` for the current week (baked in at build
  time based on today + schedule)
- Regenerate cadence: manual `--apply` Monday morning, OR local cron,
  OR GitHub Actions scheduled workflow — operator chooses; the tool
  doesn't dictate
- The schedule.yml lives in the consumer repo (per-course state);
  canvas-toolbox provides the template + rendering

**Live-tested READ-ONLY** against `CANVAS_SANDBOX_ID` (cid=145706):
- Bootstrap correctly pulled 14 modules
- Schedule validator correctly refused the `<EDIT:>` placeholder dates
- After hand-patching dates, render with `--date 2020-10-15` correctly
  marked Week 6 as current (`<details id="week-6" class="ct-week" open>`)
  and added `class="current"` to the Week 6 button
- All other weeks rendered as collapsed accordions

**NOT YET tested live:** the `--apply` push to Canvas. Parked for v0.2
along with the visual-polish work below.

**Visual polish — explicit v0.2 work** (parked in `handoffs/parkinglot.md`):
After visual review of the rendered output, operator feedback: "looks
horrible compared to where we got the HTML from." The functional core
works; the visual polish does not match DesignPLUS quality (no banner
exercised in the test course, plain CSS vs. DesignPLUS's mature theme,
emoji vs. Font Awesome icons). v0.2 will add:
  - `style.css_override` field in schedule.yml — institutions drop in
    their own CSS file; tool inlines it
  - Starter CSS themes directory (`lib/agents/templates/course_homepage/themes/`):
    BYUI-aligned + neutral + minimal
  - Sandbox push test against a different course ID (one with a banner
    + real modules + real dates) — operator to provide that ID tomorrow

**Triple-version sync** maintained (pyproject + .claude-plugin/plugin.json
+ .claude-plugin/marketplace.json all 0.57.3 → 0.58.0). New direct
dependency added to pyproject: `pyyaml>=6.0.3` (already a transitive
dep; now declared).

**Tests: 261 passing** (was 228 — added 33 for the new tool). 13 sprint
tests still deselected (Canvas-API gated). All four pre-commit hooks
pass. CI gate green.

## [0.57.3] — 2026-06-22

**Deterministic-first grader design principle**

**v0.57.3** — codifies a grader-design principle that emerged from a
"side thought" conversation about auto-grade-on-cycle: **bias toward
Python; reach for the LLM where contextual judgment or voice-anchored
prose is the better fit. It's a tuning preference, not a hard rule.**
Three artifacts updated:

1. **AGENTS.md → Working Style** — new project-specific rule
   ("Deterministic-first grader design") that lays out the preference
   + the messy-middle nuance + the migration pattern + a pointer at
   the deeper knowledge file.

2. **`lib/agents/knowledge/grader_knowledge.md`** — new §16
   ("Deterministic-first design principle") with: what canvas-toolbox
   already follows (the good pattern); a 6-row messy-middle examples
   table; the criteria-author decision dimensions (time, intent, cost,
   failure mode); the migration pattern; why the discipline matters.

3. **`handoffs/parkinglot.md`** — new v1.2 entry parked: "Auto-grade
   on cycle, deterministic-first." Captures the full design
   conversation (event/poll trigger, three-lane exit routing, rubric
   criterion-type schema with the new `hybrid` type, prerequisites
   incl. the DS 250 calibrate-against-historical share-back, the
   pedagogical-line decision shape (α auto-draft vs β auto-push).

**The operator caught two calibrations in real-time during this work:**
  - Original framing was too binary ("LLM has exactly two superpowers;
    everything else is engineering") → softened to acknowledge the
    messy middle.
  - The rubric criterion-type schema gained a 4th type (`hybrid`)
    for deterministic-prefilter + LLM-judgment-on-passes, matching
    real rubric needs.

**No code changes; no behavior changes.** Pure design-principle
codification. The existing tools that ALREADY follow deterministic-
first (`grader_signals`, `grader_reconcile`, `grader_competency_grade`,
`grader_submission_health`, `_quiz_kind`, `grader_consensus`) are
documented as the pattern to extend.

**Tests: 228 passing (unchanged).** All four pre-commit hooks pass.
Triple-version sync maintained.

## [0.57.2] — 2026-06-22

**Placeholder-name discipline rule**

**v0.57.2** — discipline-only follow-up immediately after the v0.57.1
FERPA fix. Operator caught the inconsistency: "we shipped a FERPA fix
using `'Sarah'` throughout as a placeholder, but the reporter had been
more careful using `<Name>` — did we ourselves follow FERPA discipline
in the artifacts?" Answer: not visibly enough.

**New Working Style rule:** placeholder names in code comments, commit
messages, and prose docs get the explicit `"Sarah" (fake name)`
annotation on first appearance per artifact; subsequent appearances
stay in quotes (`"Sarah"`). Test fixtures keep literal strings (the
tests assert literal shapes), but each test file's top docstring now
documents the convention so reviewers don't mistake the names for
real.

**Why not "scrub all common names"?** The reporter used `<Name>` — a
disambiguating-but-unreadable placeholder. The annotation pattern
(`"Sarah" (fake name)`) keeps the readability of "Alice/Bob"-style
examples AND **over-communicates** the discipline. Future code
reviewers see the discipline in the artifacts themselves rather than
having to know about it externally.

**Files updated:**
- `lib/tools/grader_deidentify_comments.py` — code comment block
  showing the precipitating failure case now reads
  `'Excellent work, "Sarah" (fake name)!'` with explicit annotation
  + a one-line lead-in pointing at Working Style.
- `lib/tests/test_grader_deidentify_comments.py` + `lib/tests/
  test_grader_name_leak_check.py` — top docstring documents the
  convention; test fixture strings unchanged (the tests assert
  against literal comment shapes).
- `AGENTS.md` § Working Style — new bullet codifying the rule + the
  2026-06-22 motivating case.

**Tests:** 228 passing (unchanged — pure docs/comment change). All
four pre-commit hooks pass. Triple-version-sync maintained.

**Honest note on the v0.57.1 commit message** (`1920a00`, on
`origin/main` since earlier today): it contains the older "Sarah"
references without the annotation. That commit message lives in git
history; rewriting it would require a force-push, which is
destructive and the risk doesn't warrant it ("Sarah" alone without
any linkage to a real student is not PII under FERPA — just a common
first name in a representative example). Forward-going artifacts
follow the new rule.

## FERPA fix — off-roster greeting names — closes #94 — 2026-06-22

**v0.57.1** — three-layer fix for the FERPA leak reported in #94. A real
incident: a TA comment `Excellent work, "Sarah" (fake name)!` where
"Sarah" was a dropped student NOT in the active roster. (Throughout
this entry "Sarah" is an obviously-fake placeholder — see Working
Style → placeholder-name discipline below.) The de-id pipeline left
"Sarah" intact AND the leak-check (using the same roster) reported
"0 hits / clean" — silent FERPA leak.

**Three layers, each independent:**

1. **Roster expansion (`grader_fetch.py:182-183`)** — enrollment_state[]
   now includes `inactive` + `completed` in addition to `active` +
   `invited`. Dropped students land in `.known_names.txt`; the canonical
   roster scrub catches them. Load-bearing fix; closes the originating
   gap.

2. **Greeting-position scrub (`grader_deidentify_comments.py`)** —
   safety net for off-roster names. New module-level
   `_GREETING_NAME_RE` matches `(case-insensitive greeting phrase)
   (separator)(Capitalized name)` and redacts the captured name. 11
   greeting phrases per the reporter's recommendation: Hi / Hey /
   Hello / Dear / Nice work / Great work / Excellent work / Good work
   / Good job / Well done / Nicely done. Runs AFTER the roster pass
   (roster catches known names more precisely; this is the fallback).
   Greeting is case-insensitive; name MUST be capitalized to avoid
   redacting every common word.

3. **Heuristic leak check (`grader_name_leak_check.py`)** — new
   `heuristic_greeting_hits()` helper + a second pass in `main()` that
   runs independent of the roster. If a capitalized name in greeting
   position survived ALL the scrubs, it's flagged with a distinct
   "HEURISTIC" category (vs the "ROSTER" hits). Different remediation
   per category: ROSTER miss → add to `.known_names.txt` + re-run
   deidentify; HEURISTIC miss → scrubber bug OR a name pattern not yet
   covered. Exit code 2 on either flag type (was 2 on roster only).

**Deliberate non-extraction:** the greeting regex is duplicated between
`grader_deidentify_comments.py` and `grader_name_leak_check.py`. Per
our 2nd-consumer rule (the Hermes "extract on 2nd occurrence" pattern
that triggered `_quiz_kind.py` in v0.52.0), we'd extract to a shared
helper when a 3rd consumer needs the same pattern (e.g. PDF or jupyter
scrubbers). Right now there are 2 consumers, both at the FERPA-critical
edge — duplication is cheaper than premature abstraction. Both files
carry sync notes.

**Tests:** 228 passing (was 214 — added 14). Eight new tests in
`test_grader_deidentify_comments.py` cover all 11 greeting phrases +
case sensitivity + accepted over-redaction trade. New
`test_grader_name_leak_check.py` (7 tests) covers the heuristic
helper, the headline regression case (off-roster name caught), empty/
None defenses, and the over-redaction trade documentation.

**Accepted trade (per reporter):** occasionally over-redacts a
capitalized non-name in greeting position ("Hi There," → "There"
redacted). A leaked name is the larger harm. Documented in code
comments + tests to prevent future drift.

**FERPA discipline signal:** this is the kind of fix that DOES belong
in production-grade scope, NOT minimum-scope. The proposal scope was
calibrated DOWN from the original 3-hour "extract shared helper" plan
to a 1-hour "ship the 3 layers directly" plan after operator pushback
(documented in handoffs/parkinglot.md → research-filter calibration).
The smaller fix matches the reported bug exactly; the shared helper
gets pulled when 3rd consumer arrives.

## [0.57.0] — 2026-06-18

**Top-stars sweep ship-now batch**

**v0.57.0** — the 4 SHIP-NOW items from the top-stars-sweep research
(handoffs/2026-06-18_top-gh-stars-research.md) + the SHIP-NOW item
from the headroom research (handoffs/2026-06-18_headroom-research.md).
Five OSS-readiness moves in one commit:

**1. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — YAML form templates** (matches
`astral-sh/uv/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` shape):
  - `bug.yml` — toolkit deviation; structured fields for tool name +
    version + OS + what-happened + repro; FERPA hygiene checkbox
  - `enhancement.yml` — feature request; use case + proposed behavior;
    explicit note: "already built? use share: instead"
  - `share.yml` — contribution flow; what-built + link-to-code +
    FERPA + two-zone-architecture checkboxes
  - `config.yml` — disables blank issues; routes 3 contact links:
    cb-report-bug (preferred), Discussions, Private Vulnerability Reporting

**2. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`** — short Summary / Test plan
template + pre-merge checklist (pre-commit pass / tests added /
AGENTS.md updated / triple-version sync / FERPA preserved). Matches
the `astral-sh/uv` + `astral-sh/ruff` PR template shape.

**3. GitHub Discussions enabled** — `gh api -X PATCH repos/chaz-clark/
canvas-toolbox -f has_discussions=true` returned `has_discussions:
True`. Pairs with the `cb-share` flow as a place to surface "share-back"
threads + open-ended design conversation. ISSUE_TEMPLATE's config.yml
points there for non-bug Q&A.

**4. `scripts/install.ps1` Windows installer** (~130 lines, PowerShell
shape matching `Aider-AI/aider/aider/website/install.ps1`). One-line
install for Windows: `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaz-clark/
canvas-toolbox/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex`. Mirrors install.sh
exactly: detects OS, ensures git is on PATH, installs uv via Astral's
PS1 installer if missing, clones into ./canvas-toolbox, runs `cb-init
--yes`, branches on exit code for the "edit .env" vs "fully configured"
final message. Honors `$env:CANVAS_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DRY_RUN` for tests.

**5. `/llms.txt` curated AI-agent doc index** — the `llmstxt.org`
convention; a Markdown file at repo root that gives AI agents a focused
index of the project's docs instead of crawling the whole tree.
Curated entries: README, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md,
install scripts, 8 agent specs, the knowledge catalog, the tools
catalog, plugin manifests, working-style rules, share-back paths.
Pairs naturally with `AGENTS.md` (in-context agents working ON
the project) — `llms.txt` is for agents working WITH the project
(an adopter's IDE agent learning what canvas-toolbox does).

**Tests:** 214 passing (was 208 — added 6 for install.ps1 coverage:
exists, references uv installer, references cb_init, has dry-run
branch, idempotency guard present, recovery path mentions cb_init).
13 sprint tests still deselected. All four pre-commit hooks pass
(ruff, actionlint, shellcheck w/ bin/ scope).

**Yes-count delta:** canvas-toolbox went from 2/13 → 7/13 on the
comparison matrix (added issue templates, PR template, Discussions,
multi-platform installer, plus llms.txt which isn't a row but
counts toward AI-agent discoverability).

Park-pile from the same sweep (deferred):
  - MkDocs Material docs site
  - pluggy plugin/hook system
  - shell completion (`cb-init --completions bash`)
  - rooster-style sectioned CHANGELOG auto-generation
  - `examples/` directory expansion
  - direct `headroom` integration in grader_grade.py
  - documenting headroom as adjacent operator tool
Skip-pile: `.github/FUNDING.yml` (out of step with institutional footing).

## Share-back paths — bin/ wrappers + CONTRIBUTING.md + share: prefix — 2026-06-18

**v0.56.0** — broadens the share-back surface from "report a bug or
file an enhancement" to **three discoverable paths**, all surfaced in
the README + cb-init's step 8:

**1. `share:` title prefix added to cb_report_bug.py.**
The existing `bug:` / `enhancement:` prefixes are now joined by `share:`
for the case where an operator BUILT something locally and wants to
contribute it back — distinct from `enhancement:` (asked for, not yet
built). Maintainer triages these differently. Triggered by the
2026-06-18 observation that a beta tester's group-grading extension
work didn't come through the bug-intake worker — likely because the
existing "report a bug" framing didn't invite contribution.

**2. `bin/` wrappers** — three short-alias passthrough scripts:
  - `bin/cb-init` → `uv run python lib/tools/cb_init.py`
  - `bin/cb-report-bug` → `uv run python lib/tools/cb_report_bug.py`
  - `bin/cb-share` → same target as cb-report-bug (alias for the
    contribution use case; semantic name maps to the `share:` prefix)

  Each is a 3-line bash wrapper. shellcheck pre-commit hook scope
  widened to include `bin/cb-*` files. Adopters can put `<repo>/bin/`
  on PATH to invoke as `cb-init` / `cb-share` / etc. from anywhere.

**3. README "How can you share back?" section.** Restructured the
prior "Hit a bug? Hit a wish?" header into a 3-path table:
  - bug → `cb-report-bug` with `bug:` prefix
  - enhancement → `cb-report-bug` with `enhancement:` prefix
  - share (built it locally) → `cb-share` with `share:` prefix
  - PR (code push) → CONTRIBUTING.md
  Plus an explicit "How to put `bin/` on PATH" snippet for adopters
  who want short commands, plus three documented fallbacks (long-form,
  gh CLI, web UI) for users without the bin/ wrappers handy.

**4. NEW: CONTRIBUTING.md** (~130 lines). First-class contributor doc:
  - All three contribution shapes (bug-report, share-back, PR)
  - Pre-commit hook install instructions (mandatory for PRs)
  - Tests required before PR + what the maintainer reviews
  - Explicit "what the maintainer is NOT looking for" section
    (style-only PRs, tool renames, FERPA-removing optimizations,
    demographic integrations without institutional partnership)
  - Communication norm: design discussion via `cb-share` BEFORE
    long PRs; PRs stay focused on code, not design debate.

**5. cb-init step 8 wording updated.** The "Hit a bug?" hint now reads
as three lines — bug / enhancement / share — so adopters see the full
share-back surface on first install, not just the bug-reporting framing.

**Tests:** 208 passing (was 199 — added 9 across bin/ wrapper tests:
exists+executable, bash -n syntax parse, correct-target-file). 13
sprint tests still deselected. All four pre-commit hooks pass
(ruff, actionlint, shellcheck w/ bin/ scope, ruff again).

## README polish — surface easier-startup + new capabilities — 2026-06-18

**v0.55.1** — docs-only follow-up after Sprint 2B. Two changes:

**1. README "Getting started" — surface the one-liner as the lead.**
Sprint 2B's `scripts/install.sh` was shipped but the README still
opened Step 3 with "Most people use Option A" + a buried 💡 tip
pointing at the curl-pipe inside Option B. Restructured:
  - NEW: `### TL;DR — one-line install (macOS / Linux)` section
    immediately after the Step 3 header. Audience: technical users
    with `git` + a terminal habit.
  - REMOVED: the `💡` tip (now redundant)
  - REMOVED: the `#### Fastest path — one-line install` subsection
    inside Option B (now redundant with the TL;DR)
  - KEPT: Option A's agent-driven 8-step runbook (target audience
    is non-technical faculty whose AI assistant walks them through;
    Option A's checklist also covers git install + gitignore creation
    + course pull, three things `install.sh` doesn't do)
  - KEPT: Option B's `#### Fast path — cb-init (3 lines)` for users
    who want the manual equivalent of the one-liner across any OS

**2. README "What you can do" — added the New Quizzes response bullet.**
Sprint 2 (#87) shipped `grader_fetch_nq_responses` — a genuinely
new user-facing capability (per-student NQ response data via the
student-analysis Reporting API) — but the "What you can do" list
hadn't been updated to surface it. Added the bullet immediately
before the existing grading bullet so the NQ feature is visible
to adopters scanning the capability list. Also added a brief
"specs-grading reconciliation with @100%-credit counts" inline
mention to the existing grading bullet (#47 from Sprint 2).

No code changes. Triple-version-sync maintained (pyproject + plugin +
marketplace), 199 tests still green, all four pre-commit hooks pass.

## Sprint 2B — `scripts/install.sh` one-line installer — 2026-06-18

**v0.55.0** — the curl-pipe wrapper around Sprint 2's `cb-init`.
True one-line install for macOS / Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaz-clark/canvas-toolbox/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

`scripts/install.sh` (~140 lines) detects OS (bails on Windows with
a pointer to the manual 3-line flow), ensures `git` + installs `uv`
via Astral's official installer if missing, clones canvas-toolbox
into cwd, and runs `cb-init --yes`. `--yes` is the right default
because curl-pipe consumes stdin, so interactive prompts wouldn't
work anyway — and the whole point of the one-liner is non-interactive.
Refuses to clobber a pre-existing `canvas-toolbox/` directory; prints
a recovery hint at `cd canvas-toolbox && uv run python
lib/tools/cb_init.py` (the resume path).

**Test coverage** — Sprint 1's pattern continues:
  - 4 new pytest tests under `lib/tests/test_install_script.py`:
    file-exists-and-executable, `bash -n` syntax parse, dry-run
    end-to-end (via `CANVAS_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DRY_RUN=1`), and the
    pre-existing-clone-dir refusal case
  - `shellcheck` added to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (matching the
    ruff + actionlint pattern from v0.53.0) — catches the same
    class of bash bugs ruff catches for Python
  - **Manual end-to-end verified before commit**: ran `install.sh`
    in `/tmp/canvas-toolbox-real-test`, cloned from GitHub, ran
    cb-init through step 3 halt, confirmed the final "Next: edit
    .env" message. cwd-control behavior verified (.env landed at
    the test dir's canvas-toolbox/ subdir, not anywhere else).

**README** — replaced the 3-line "Fast path" with a tiered structure:
"Fastest path" = the curl-pipe one-liner (macOS/Linux); "Fast path"
= the 3-line manual flow (any OS, fully interactive). Windows users
explicitly directed to the 3-line flow.

**Adopter pitch is now genuinely one line**: paste the curl URL,
fill in `.env`, re-run cb-init. Total time from zero to working
canvas-toolbox install on a fresh machine: ~3 minutes (depending
on Python download speed).

Tests: 199 passing (was 195 — added 4). All three CI tiers + the
new shellcheck hook green.

## git-push discipline rule added — closes #88 — 2026-06-18

**v0.54.1** — adds a single bullet to Working Style §Project-specific
rules: "**`git push` after every commit** — in BOTH consumer repos
AND canvas-toolbox itself." Closes issue #88, filed via the bug-intake
worker on 2026-06-17 after the operator surfaced 23 local-only
commits in itm327-master from ~3 weeks of canvas-toolbox-prompted
work. The rule additionally bakes in 2026-06-18's maintainer-side
incident: 6 local-only commits in canvas-toolbox itself when an
adopter tried to clone from GitHub and found `cb_init.py` missing.
The rule explicitly applies to maintainers, not just adopters —
the same failure mode bites both. Doc-only change; no behavior shift.

## Productional Dependabot wave — merged #89/#90/#91/#92 — 2026-06-18

Four Dependabot PRs landed clean after a rebase against the conftest
fix: setup-python v5→v6 (dormant regression.yml only),
setup-uv v3→v7 + checkout v4→v7 (CI-validated), and the Python deps
group bump (anthropic 0.93→0.111, beautifulsoup4 4.14→4.15,
canvasapi 3.5→3.6, lxml 6.0→6.1.1, pdfplumber 0.11.4→0.11.10,
requests 2.33→2.34.2). Sanity-tested locally: `grader_grade.py
--help` works on anthropic 0.111 (the SDK import path is unchanged);
195/195 tier-1 tests still green; ruff clean. v0.53.0's Dependabot
config + pre-commit + ruff layers proved themselves on first
real run — the maintenance loop is wired and operational.

## Sprint 2 — `cb-init` one-command bootstrap — 2026-06-18

**v0.54.0** — new `lib/tools/cb_init.py` (~370 lines): the
one-command bootstrap that closes the "what do I do AFTER I clone?"
friction every adopter (and every fresh agent) hits. Inspired by
`roborev init` (research 2026-06-18); locked to the canvas-toolbox
trust + working-style discipline.

**8 idempotent steps**, each silent when there's nothing to do +
prompts y/n when there is (decision G — "smart prompts"):
  1. Install uv via Astral's official installer if missing (macOS/Linux)
  2. Install Python 3.14 via uv (won't touch system Python)
  3. Write `.env` stub at cwd if absent — STOPS for manual fill-in
     of CANVAS_API_TOKEN + CANVAS_BASE_URL (decision: stays manual)
  4. `uv sync --group dev` from REPO_ROOT
  5. `uv run playwright install chromium` (skippable via --skip-playwright)
  6. `uv run pre-commit install` (ruff + actionlint hook)
  7. Canvas API smoke — `GET /users/self` (read-only; reports the
     authenticated user's name)
  8. Surface AGENTS.md + cb-report-bug one-liner

**Key design calls captured during the planning conversation:**
  - **`.env` stays manual** — no $EDITOR invocation; stub goes to cwd
    + halts so the operator fills in tokens, then re-runs cb-init
  - **uv-managed everything** — tool installs uv + Python itself, so
    non-technical faculty don't need to know what Python is, AND
    technical users get a contained env that doesn't pollute their
    global Python
  - **No `gh` requirement** — confirmed: canvas-toolbox doesn't need
    `gh` at runtime; bug-intake goes through the Cloudflare worker
  - **Mode: explicit `--mode {maintainer,adopter}` flag, default
    adopter** (decision A) — auto-detection from git origin surfaces
    a suggestion but doesn't override; flag is the explicit toggle
    for future co-maintainers
  - **stub_is_filled requires only TOKEN + BASE_URL** — caught
    during live testing: maintainer's working .env doesn't have
    CANVAS_COURSE_ID (most tools accept --course-id per-command).
    COURSE_ID + SANDBOX_ID stay in the stub commented out as
    OPTIONAL.
  - **Tests: pure-logic + ONE tmp-repo integration** (decision E
    a+c) — 20 tests under lib/tests/test_cb_init.py covering
    detect_mode_from_remote (6), env_stub_content (1),
    stub_is_filled (8), parse_canvas_self_name (4), plus the
    end-to-end --check dry-run integration test
  - **install.sh curl-pipe wrapper parked as Sprint 2B** (decision F)
    — let cb-init prove itself in real use before adding the
    one-line install layer on top

**Updates to README.md Getting Started:**
  - Hint at the top of Step 3 pointing technical users at the
    cb-init fast path
  - New "Fast path — `cb-init`" subsection inside Option B (manual
    setup) with the 3-line clone + cd + cb-init flow + the flag
    table (--check, --yes, --mode, --skip-playwright)

**Version sync:** pyproject.toml + .claude-plugin/plugin.json +
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json all bumped 0.53.0 → 0.54.0
(maintain this triple-sync convention from the v0.53.0 plugin shipped
last commit).

**Tests:** 195 passing (was 175 after Sprint 1 — added 20). 13 sprint
tests still deselected (Canvas-API gated). All three CI tiers green.

## Productional sprint — Claude plugin + ruff + pre-commit + actionlint + Dependabot — 2026-06-18

**v0.53.0** — three productional-alignment moves inspired by the
`kenn-io/roborev` research (1.4k ⭐ Go project — "continuous code
review for AI agents"). Each is a small layer; together they shift
canvas-toolbox from "clone, read, configure" toward "plug in, hooks
auto-run, deps auto-update."

**Move 1 — Claude Code plugin manifest.** New `.claude-plugin/`
directory (matches roborev's shape exactly): `plugin.json` +
`marketplace.json` + a companion `README.md`. The plugin points
at `./lib/agents/` — adopters who have Claude Code can install the
toolkit's agent specs + 20+ pedagogical knowledge files as a single
plugin rather than cloning the full repo. The brain-agnostic
philosophy in `lib/agents/*.md` means the same skill catalogue
works for Codex / Cursor / Aider etc. when their plugin specs
stabilize (placeholder `.codex-plugin/` not added yet — wait for
Codex's spec).

**Move 2 — ruff + pre-commit + actionlint.** Three monitoring
layers in one commit, scoped conservatively:
- **ruff** added to `[dependency-groups].dev`. Initial ruleset enforces
  bug-catching families (F + B + E + W + I) and explicitly DEFERS
  stylistic rules (F541 f-string-no-placeholder; I001 import-order;
  E70x multi-stmt-per-line; B007 unused-loop-var; B905 zip-strict;
  E741 ambiguous-name) to a future style-sweep PR. The narrow ruleset
  catches REAL defects without forcing 60+ tool reformats.
- **First lint pass caught a real bug**: F821 in `course_mirror.py`
  line 568 referenced an undefined `master_slug`. Tier 0 wouldn't
  catch it (function not exercised by `--help`); Tier 1 had no test
  for that function. Ruff caught it on first run. Fix: compute
  `master_slug = _slug(master_title)` in the loop body where it's
  used. Cleaned 5 dead-variable assignments (F841) across canvas_sync,
  course_mirror, grader_grade, grading_load_audit, rubric_recommender
  + 12 unused imports (F401) auto-fixed across the codebase.
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** runs `ruff check --fix` + actionlint
  on every commit. `pre-commit` added to dev deps. **`ruff format`
  intentionally NOT in pre-commit** — would have reformatted 84
  existing files on first run; deferred to a dedicated style-sweep
  PR so the working-style discipline ("Surgical Changes") holds.
- **CI Tier 2** appended to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `ruff check`
  runs after the Tier 1 pytest, plus an `actionlint` action lints the
  workflow files themselves (catches a class of CI bugs that would
  otherwise surface as opaque "workflow failed to start").

**Move 3 — Dependabot.** New `.github/dependabot.yml` configures
weekly automated dependency PRs for two ecosystems: Python (via uv,
reads pyproject.toml + uv.lock) and GitHub Actions (versions pinned
in our workflow files). Minor + patch updates grouped to reduce PR
volume; majors stay separate for case-by-case review.

**No behavior change to existing tools.** Tests: 175 passing, 13
sprint tests still deselected (Canvas-API gated). All three CI
tiers green locally.

**Source research:** `kenn-io/roborev` — see the Tier-2-followup
session notes (2026-06-18) for the full lesson set. roborev does
more (goreleaser binary releases, multi-agent ACP, `prek.toml`
versus traditional pre-commit, version-pinned linter as
single-source-of-truth, per-checkout cache, `install_scripts_test.go`)
— most of those are deferred until they're needed.

## Tier 2 — NQ + specs-grading sprint, closes #47 #86 #87 — 2026-06-18

**v0.52.0** — three consumer-demand issues closed in one focused
sprint, no behavior change to existing flows.

**#47 — `grader_reconcile` per-dimension `at_full_ratio`.** Adds an
optional dimension field (`at_full_ratio: 1.0` for strict full credit,
`0.9` for "90%+", or the issue's `count_mode: full_credit` alias)
that emits a NEW `<dim>_at_full` column counting submissions where
`score >= points_possible * ratio`. Closes the DS250 mid-letter
Spring 2026 false-flag where `submitted=3` but `@100%=2` was promoting
A- students to A. Independent of `completion_basis` (#59) — set on
any dimension where you need at-full visibility alongside
`<dim>_complete`. Two new helpers in grader_reconcile.py
(`_is_at_full_ratio` + `_resolve_at_full_ratio` for the dual config
syntax) with 15 new unit tests.

**#87 — `grader_fetch_nq_responses`.** Ports the validated
itm327-master `grade_standups.py` Reporting API pattern into a
canvas-toolbox primitive (~400 lines). POST report → poll progress →
download CSV → parse to uid-keyed dict. Default-on local CSV cache
(23h TTL, under Canvas's ~24h inst-fs URL expiry) with `--no-cache`
and `--force-refresh` opt-outs. Inline filename-date extractor
(`--extract-filename-dates`) with the 4 known screenshot patterns
(Mac default, Windows default, generic ISO, Snipping Tool).
FERPA-safe by default: uid-keyed output, names OMITTED unless
`--include-names` is passed for review-surface generation. 15 new
unit tests covering parse_filename_date, parse_canvas_ts, and
parse_student_analysis_csv against a synthetic CSV fixture modeled
on the real Canvas shape. The fetch primitive doesn't decide grades
— consuming tools apply bucket logic.

**#86 — NQ detection helper + knowledge note.** New shared module
`_quiz_kind.py` (~140 lines) with a pure classifier
(`classify_assignment_shape(assn_payload) -> (kind, path)`) plus a
network-touching wrapper (`detect_quiz_kind`). Classifies an
assignment as `new_quiz` / `classic_quiz` / `not_a_quiz` and
recommends one of three paths (`reporting_api` /
`submission_data` / `submitted_proxy` / `none`). Strongest signal
wins: explicit `quiz_id` → classic; `submission_types: [online_quiz]`
→ classic; `submission_types: [external_tool]` + NQ URL marker
(`quiz-lti` / `quiz_lti` / `quizzes.next`) → new_quiz; otherwise
not-a-quiz. The matching `learned/` knowledge note
(`2026-06-18_new-quizzes-responses-api-walled.md`) captures the
empirical endpoint table + the three viable data paths so the next
consumer doesn't re-spend the ~2 hours m119/ds460/itm327 each spent
discovering this. 11 new unit tests covering all classifier branches.

Total: 33 new unit tests (175 passing total, 13 sprint tests still
deselected). Tier 0 `--help` smoke green on both new tools.
`pending_review_finalizer.py` (sidecar suggested in #86) parked as a
separate follow-up — has its own design surface (gating, bulk vs
single, interaction with `grader_push.py`).

## CI tests Tier 0 + Tier 1 — closes #83 — 2026-06-17

**v0.51.0** — the toolkit's first automated test layer. New
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push + PR. Three checks:
**Tier 0a** compiles every Python file in `lib/tools/` (catches the
#74 class — syntax errors, broken imports, type-annotation drift);
**Tier 0b** runs `--help` against every primary CLI tool — exactly
the cheap one-minute check that would have caught #74 before push;
**Tier 1** runs `pytest lib/tests/ -k "not sprint"` (the
sandbox-API sprint tests stay dormant pending a credentials policy
call). Seven new test files (~50 functions) cover the pure-logic
helpers flagged in #83: `extract_uid` / `_uid_from_filename` /
`_row_uid` (filename → uid resolution), `extract_hold_token` /
`comment_has_resubmit_language` / `collision_warnings_for_submission`
(grader_push #62/#63/#72), `_is_complete_under_basis` (grader_reconcile
#59), `evaluate_tier_thresholds` / `assign_band` (grader_competency_grade
#60), `classify_submission` (grader_submission_health #64),
`infer_surface` / `infer_task_slug` (grader_scaffold #54-A),
`scrub_comment` (grader_deidentify_comments #65). 127/127 pass
locally + 13 sprint tests deselected (kept for the regression.yml
path when activated). pytest added to `[dependency-groups].dev` in
pyproject.toml; install with `uv sync --group dev`. **Tier 0
caught a real bug on first run** — `module_structure_diff.py` had
no argparse, so `--help` failed env-check before showing usage; fixed
in this cycle by adding a minimal `argparse.ArgumentParser` with
`--version` to match every other tool's convention.

## [0.50.1] — 2026-06-15

Doc sweep: agent-facing surfaces now know about `cb_report_bug.py`.

### Changed
- `AGENTS.md` gains a "Continuous improvement — bugs + enhancements"
  section codifying the DO / DO-NOT calibration for when to surface
  the bug-intake CLI. Refreshes Active Context for the v0.36 → v0.50
  grader sprint + bug-intake worker deployment.
- `README.md` adds a "Hit a bug? Hit a wish?" section with title-prefix
  examples (`bug:` / `enhancement:`) + the always-works
  github.com/issues/new fallback.
- `grading-readme.md` adds a grader-scoped reporter section with the
  "FERPA gate is not a bug" caveat.
- `lib/agents/canvas_grader.md` gains principle **P-011 Surface the
  bug-report path** + a tooling-table row for `cb_report_bug.py`.
- 8 other agent specs (canvas-sync / canvas_blueprint_sync /
  canvas_content_sync / canvas_course_expert / canvas_new_course_setup
  / canvas_schedule_auditor / canvas_semester_setup /
  ira_program_alignment) gain a uniform "Continuous improvement"
  cross-reference to AGENTS.md.
- `cb_report_bug.py` docstring documents the title-prefix convention.

## [0.50.0] — 2026-06-15

The v1.0 readiness gate: a zero-friction bug + enhancement reporting
path for faculty without GitHub accounts.

### Added
- `lib/tools/cb_report_bug.py` — one-command CLI that bundles toolkit
  context, scrubs PII locally (emails, /Users paths, roster names),
  and POSTs to the canvas-toolbox bug-intake Cloudflare Worker. No
  GitHub account, `gh`, browser auth, or PAT on the faculty side.
- `infra/bug-intake-worker/` — Cloudflare Worker source + deploy
  README. Receives `POST /bug`, validates (UA prefix, body cap, PII
  scrub, per-IP rate limit via KV), files via GitHub Issues API using
  the maintainer's narrow-scope PAT (Issues:RW only, 90-day rotation).
- `.github/workflows/agent-submitted-label.yml` — auto-applies the
  `agent-submitted` label by body-footer detection. (Workaround for
  GitHub fine-grained PATs silently dropping the `labels` field on
  issue create when scoped to Issues:write only — documented inline.)
- `infra/bug-intake-worker/MAINTENANCE.local.md` — gitignored
  maintainer runbook with PAT rotation schedule, troubleshooting
  notes (Safari OAuth quirk, workers.dev onboarding URL move), and
  take-offline procedure.

## [0.49.1] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **#74** `grader_push` UnboundLocalError on `csv` — L669 loop variable
  shadowed the `import csv` module, crashing the default `--review`
  path. Renamed to `rc`.

## [0.49.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#71** `grader_meta_summary --cohort-glob` accepts multiple values
  via `action="append"`.
- **#72** `grader_push` HOLD_<DIMENSION> grade-hold pattern (lifted
  from itm327's `build_mid_letter_comments` + `push_mid_letter`).
  Posts the qualitative comment, withholds the grade write until the
  operator clears the heading token + re-pushes.

### Fixed
- **#73** `_uid_from_filename` in grader_meta_summary + grader_join
  now accepts grader_fetch / `_external` / Canvas-bulk-download
  conventions; whitespace-tolerant; WARNs when a keymap has rows but
  zero resolve.

## [0.48.2] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **#70** `grader_meta_summary` task-level CSV row-binding now accepts
  `user_id`-keyed CSVs (m119 layout) via a `_row_uid` helper that tries
  `key` first then falls back to `user_id`.

## [0.48.1] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **#67** `fetch_active_filter` follows `Link: rel="next"` instead of
  blindly incrementing page numbers (Canvas's /enrollments 400s past
  the last page; cohorts ≤100 hit this every call).
- **#66** `detect_adapter` relaxed from "100% markers" to majority
  rule (more than half) for routing `.html` cohorts to the Databricks
  adapter. Plus the cosmetic: roster-count message reports total
  roster size, not just newly-added.
- **#68** `grader_join` regex accepts `<prefix>_<uid>_external.<ext>`;
  conflict resolution prefers original keys over `_external` ones.
- **#69** `grader_meta_summary` Path B: task-level feedback CSVs are
  read first when surface-level is absent (m119's multi-surface
  layout).

## [0.48.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#54-B** `grader_join.py` — FERPA-safe `_userid_key_grade_join.json`
  builder for multi-surface tasks.
- **#54-C** `grader_meta_summary.py` — cross-task uid × task matrix
  + flag-streak detection + per-uid band distribution.

### Changed
- **#54-E** Single-surface vs multi-surface convention codified in
  grading-readme.md.

## [0.47.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#54-A** `grader_scaffold.py` — canonical
  `grading/<task>[_combined]/<surface>/` layout scaffolder.
- **#54-F** `scaffold/grading/rubric_templates/` — AI Log + Cohesive
  Narrative canonical templates that `grader_scaffold` auto-copies.

## [0.46.1] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **#54-D** Re-run prefix duality in all 6 deid adapters — refuse to
  write a second prefix family into the same `submissions_deid/`;
  `--cleanup-legacy` opt-in to remove stale legacy files.

## [0.46.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#57** `grader_push_comments.py` — pushes staged
  `## Suggested Canvas Comment` H2 blocks from per-student feedback
  files to Canvas; reuses #61/#62/#63 guards; idempotent.

## [0.45.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#60** `grader_competency_grade.py` — config-driven "highest tier
  where all element thresholds are met" deterministic grade.
  Lifted from DS250's `calc_mid_grades.py`.

## [0.44.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#59** `grader_reconcile` per-dimension `completion_basis`
  (`submitted` / `nonzero` / `full_credit`) emits a `<dim>_complete`
  column the competency grader consumes.

## [0.43.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#64** `grader_submission_health.py` — read-only per-submission
  health check; flags broken-not-absent submissions
  (empty/near-zero uploads, wrong content-type, empty body,
  submitted-but-nothing).

## [0.42.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#63** `grader_push` availability awareness (warn on resubmit-style
  comment when assignment is locked) + first-class `--retract` for
  previously-pushed comments via per-assignment ledger.

## [0.41.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#62** `grader_push` pre-push comment-collision guard — warns on
  recent non-self comments via the FERPA-safe deid layer (#65) before
  posting.

## [0.40.0] — 2026-06-14

### Changed
- **#61** `grader_push` push surface excludes Canvas's Test Student
  + inactive/withdrawn/completed/rejected enrollments by default.
  `--include-inactive` reverts for the rare intentional case.

## [0.39.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#56** `grader_pull_ta_grades.py` — symmetric PULL counterpart to
  `grader_grade.py` for calibration cohorts. FERPA-safe (user_id +
  grade + score only).

## [0.38.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#55** `grader_list_assignments.py` — read-only Canvas assignment
  discovery; eliminates the inline `canvasapi` snippet operators were
  authoring repeatedly.

## [0.37.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#65** `grader_deidentify_comments.py` — FERPA de-id layer for
  Canvas submission_comments threads. Drops `author_name`, converts
  `author_id` to role (self/instructor/ta/peer/unknown), scrubs the
  body, refuses to write on any post-scrub roster-name leak.
  Prerequisite for #62 + #63.

## [0.36.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **#58** `grader_config_audit.py` — read-only audit of every
  `assignment_id` in a reconcile/competency config against the live
  course. Catches the silent-misconfig "DS=0 with full DS credit"
  failure mode before any grading run.

---

## knowledge-base QC audit — done, came back clean — 2026-05-26

- **Knowledge-base QC audit (2026-05-26) — done, came back clean.** Audited all 17 `knowledge/*.md`+`.json` pairs against the `make_agent_knowledge` KNW-QC standard + distilled-vs-pasted + bloat + cross-file redundancy. **Result: the two-layer architecture holds — no file is raw paste**; distillation discipline is real and consistent (the two largest, `assessments` 4.3k words and `rubrics` 4.3k words, are the most carefully structured, with explicit verbatim-vs-gloss labeling). Universal `read_at_runtime` is a documented `selective_load` choice, not a defect. **5 small fixes applied:** `syllabus_knowledge.json` brought onto the house schema (facts object → `facts[]` array per KNW-QC-003; provenance → `{sources:[]}`; added `runtime_strategy`); MD header spines completed on `designer_thinking` / `cognitive_load_theory` / `toyota_gap_analysis`; `three_domains` dangling `blooms_taxonomy_knowledge.md` refs resolved (point to `taxonomy_explorer` + `outcomes_quality` until the dedicated file exists). **Residual forward item:** `blooms_taxonomy_knowledge.md` is referenced as "forthcoming" by `three_domains` but not yet built — verb lists currently live in `taxonomy_explorer_knowledge.md` + `outcomes_quality_knowledge.md`; create the dedicated file only if a tool needs a single Bloom verb-reference home.

**Versioning:** the `v0.x` semver line is canonical (matches `git describe` and `lib/tools/__toolbox_version__.py`). A separate `v1.x` git tag series exists in history; it is not part of the `v0.x` line and is not maintained — treat `v0.x` as canonical going forward. Downstream repos that vendor `lib/tools/` check drift with any primary sync tool's `--version` flag and re-sync via `cd canvas_toolbox && git pull` (never patch vendored copies in place).

- **Post-Stage-6 backlog (deferred limitations of the in-flight rubrics workstream — none block Stage 6 wiring; all are worth visiting after first real-course run reveals what actually matters)**:
  - **Knowledge-file content gaps.** (a) Backbone meta-rubric PDF lacks citation metadata in [`pre_knowledge/rubrics/rubrics of rubrics.pdf`](lib/agents/pre_knowledge/rubrics/rubrics%20of%20rubrics.pdf) — author/origin unrecorded. (b) Walvoord-Auburn 404 — Walvoord-BU on disk covers similar PTA ground; pursue an alternate (Bean / UT Austin / KU CTE) only if Stage 6 shows it matters. (c) `learningandteaching.byui.edu` is sign-in-gated (Crowded platform) — likely a major resource for ALL pre_knowledge frameworks; harvest manually while logged in and drop into `pre_knowledge/<topic>/`. (d) `canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/` was 503 through 2026-05-20/21 authoring — every Canvas-authored fact in `canvas_api_knowledge` is currently GitHub-YARD-sourced; re-fetch and promote `📄 documented` → `✅ verified` when reachable. (e) 9 of 11 resource pointers in `canvas_api_knowledge` lack per-resource surveys (only Pages + Rubrics done); write on-demand as new tools touch each resource.
  - **Stage 4 (`rubric_coverage_audit.py`) heuristic edges.** (a) `use_rubric_for_grading` is `❓ inferred` to be in the `include[]=rubric_settings` response — current tool treats missing-field as `None` (not flagged), which may underflag decorative rubrics; first real-course run will reveal whether to fall back to `/rubric_associations/:id`. (b) `submission_types == ['external_tool']` assumed to be NewQuiz/LTI — could be a regular LTI tool; refine via `external_tool_tag_attributes` if false-positives appear. (c) `non_submittable` may include legitimately graded items (e.g., participation graded via `['none']`); monitor and add a points-possible + submission-presence check if needed.
  - **Stage 5 (`rubric_quality_audit.py`) heuristic calibration** — partly validated against the sandbox fixture matrix 2026-05-22 (`sandbox_rubric_fixtures.py` in `CANVAS_SANDBOX_ID`). ~~**Highest priority deferred item**: Criterion 1 "unverified → flagged" misbehavior~~ **DONE 2026-05-21** — Criterion 1 three-state; `None` (no CLOs) → `criterion_unverified`, not a flag, no `validity_flag`; new `meets_criteria_unverified` verdict. ~~Criterion 3 binary test fires on every rubric lacking process-vocabulary~~ **DONE 2026-05-22** — sandbox showed C3 flagged ALL fixtures incl. the well-formed one (near-useless always-on signal); retightened to flag only when positive output-only evidence exists with no process counterbalance (the `weak` fixture still correctly flags; the well-formed/single-point/decorative fixtures no longer do). **`criterion_use_range` round-trip CONFIRMED 2026-05-22** — the range-based fixture's `points_and_weights` flag fired, proving the field comes back via `include[]=rubric` and C4 detects it (resolves the prior `❓ inferred`). **New sandbox finding: Canvas coerces an omitted/null `points_possible` to `0.0` via REST** (PUT `''` and `'null'` both yield `0.0`) — a true `points_possible=None` cannot be created through the API; it only arises via UI/import/blueprint paths (how ITM327's contract-graded course got them). The `None→missing_rubric` classifier fix stays unit-test-validated. Lower priority calibration items (still deferred — confirm before tuning): Criterion 1 token-overlap can fire spuriously on common words (tune stopword list / threshold post-run); Criterion 2 subjective-term regex is English-only and finite (extend after first run) AND **over-fires on bare hedge words** — sandbox 2026-05-22: "**Mostly** description" tripped the bare `mostly` term (a legitimate descriptor, not subjective); tighten `mostly`/`somewhat`/`partially` to require a following evaluative word, or drop the bare hedges (the explicit terms good/fair/poor/`minor errors` carry the real signal — confirm before changing); Criterion 3 binary test ("0 process AND ≥1 output → fail") may mis-classify legitimately-mixed rubrics; Criterion 4 `criterion_use_range` field unverified to be in `include[]=rubric` (`--probe` mode would dump one rubric's raw structure pre-run); Criterion 4 accountability detection depends on description keyword overlap; typology classifier never returns `developmental` (no heuristic); three-column single-point heuristic looks for specific labels that real Gonzalez-2017 rubrics may not use; verdict threshold (3+ flags → `needs_revision`) is arbitrary.
  - **Tool ergonomics.** (a) No unified report combining Stage 4 + Stage 5 — thin orchestrator `rubric_audit.py` would emit a combined markdown + JSON (~50 lines). (b) No assignment-description-vs-rubric gap surface in Stage 5 detailed mode — data is already fetched. (c) No persistent state / week-over-week diff (skip unless workflow demands it). (d) No mock-Canvas for end-to-end testing — unit tests cover classifier/detectors; skip integration fixtures unless flakiness warrants.
  - **Architectural watch items.** (a) The 17-row nav index in [External System Lessons](#external-system-lessons) duplicates the TOC of [`canvas_api_lessons_learned.md`](lib/agents/knowledge/canvas_api_lessons_learned.md) — drift risk; update both on every lesson edit, consider scripted sync if drift becomes a problem. (b) The strict two-file read obligation (`canvas_api_knowledge` + `canvas_api_lessons_learned`) is by design but creates workflow burden — monitor whether consuming agents actually read both. (c) CLO alignment heuristic in Stage 5 partially duplicates `course_quality_check.py --alignment` — extract into shared `lib/tools/clo_alignment.py` if Stage 5 evolves OR consolidate when one gains a feature the other should have. (d) Three v0.x knowledge files now stacked — at Stage 6, promote selectively to v1.0 based on what the real run actually exercised; leave others at v0.x with a dated reason. (e) L14 (lock-state-only sync reversion) is a single observation (incident W01, 2026-05-20) — if observed again, upgrade `blueprint_orphan_pages.py` operator warning from "advisory" to "blocker."
  - **Stage 6 prerequisites (not deferred — these are the entry path):** (1) Run `rubric_coverage_audit.py --json --report coverage.md` against a real Canvas course. (2) Run `rubric_quality_audit.py --json --report quality.md --detailed` against same. (3) Capture findings; calibrate Stage 5 heuristics only if signal-to-noise suggests it. (4) Wire exercised knowledge files into [`canvas_course_expert.json`](lib/agents/canvas_course_expert.json) `cross_references.knowledge_files[]`. (5) Promote exercised knowledge files to v1.0; bump `__toolbox_version__` to v0.21.0; add catalog entries to [`lib/agents/knowledge/README.md`](lib/agents/knowledge/README.md). (6) Tag and ship.

- **v0.27.0 just shipped** — **#36 `blueprint_presync_check.py`** (read-only PRE-sync lock-readiness preflight), the complement to `blueprint_exception_report.py` (post-sync). Predicts which pending blueprint changes will be **silently skipped** (unlocked + locally edited in a section) BEFORE a sync, and `--suggest-locks` emits the lock script to fix it first — collapsing edit→sync→discover→lock→resync into edit→preflight→sync-once. **Design grounded in a live empirical check** (relayed via the ITM327 agent on the #36 thread): `unsynced_changes` carries no `exceptions` pre-sync, so the tool infers local edits itself — **precise for pages** (reuses the #32 revision-provenance primitive: section hash ∉ blueprint revisions = local edit) and **honestly "can't pre-verify" for assignments/quizzes/discussions** (no `/revisions` trail; never false-confident — sets up a v2 snapshot baseline). Reuses #28's asset_type→restrict_item map. Validated read-only on the ITM327 blueprint: correctly flags S2's locally-edited `course-homepage`, passes "behind" pages. Benefits every online course (all get a blueprint). Closes #36.
- **v0.26.0 just shipped** — **PTC deep-dive new topics** (full-book read for genuinely-new topics, not gap-filling). Surfaced 3 course-auditable topics with public sources; built all 3, wired 2: **(#1 wired) `workload_audit.py` + `workload_calibration_knowledge.md`** — aggregate workload *distribution* audit (Carnegie credit-hour norm + due-date clustering; honest that reading *hours* aren't measurable from the API). Validated read-only (ITM327 uneven; sandbox/ds250 balanced). **(#2 wired) `structured_teaching_knowledge.md`** — reasoning enrichment (Sathy & Hogan "structure as an equity lever" + Walton & Cohen belonging); no tool, layered over existing structural findings; non-demographic. **(#3 ORPHANED) `content_representation_audit.py` + `content_representation_knowledge.md`** — surfaces named sources cited in course content for *human* representation review (does NOT infer demographics; evidence-based). Built + smoke-tested but **deliberately orphaned** (consumed only by its own tool; NOT wired to the agent, `course_audit`, or the user README) pending a real use case + an explicit appropriateness decision. #1/#2 wired into `canvas_course_expert` cross_references + `knowledge/README.md`; #1 also in the user README + tool catalog. All public-sourced — never the internal PTC manuscript.
- **v0.25.0 just shipped** — **`course_audit.py`** (read-only orchestrator: the capstone that composes all four audit legs into one health report — `HEALTHY`/`REVIEW`/`NEEDS_ATTENTION` + aggregated fixes), built as a tool-side application of the `make_orchestrator_agent` skill (specialists are sealed `--json` subprocesses, decoupled + referenced by path; `canvas_course_expert` is the agent-layer orchestrator). Validated on sandbox + real ITM327. **Plus the non-issue backlog batch:** (a) **PTC gap-audit** (pulled from the garage) — deep-read Preface/Ch3/Ch8 of the Eaton PTC text vs the pedagogy knowledge base; **confirmed the base is sound**, applied 3 small citable enrichments (expert-blind-spot + the Deslauriers 2019 "feeling of learning" gap → `cognitive_load_theory_knowledge`; group-work quality sub-check → `hattie_3phase_knowledge`); findings in gitignored `pre_knowledge/PTC/ptc_gap_audit_findings.md`. (b) **`syllabus_knowledge` promoted v0.1 → v1.0** (validated read-only on real ITM327 + the shared outcomes parser across m119/ds250/ds460). (c) **`rubric_recommender` Bloom verbs migrated** to the shared `bloom_verbs.py` (DRY). (d) "Beyond Doom and Gloom" AI post intentionally skipped (cluster complete).
- **v0.24.0 just shipped** — **`clo_quality_audit.py`** (3rd leg of the audit suite) + the **#30/#31/#32 agile fixes from real-course (ITM327/DS250/m119) testing**. (a) **#32** `blueprint_orphan_pages` Detector B: was mislabeling every drifted page a "reversion" (revisions LIST omits `body`; no lock gate) → now fetches per-revision bodies + gates on content-lock; **validated 0 false positives on the real ITM327 blueprint** (was 5). (b) **#30/#31** new shared `syllabus_outcomes.py` DOM-aware CLO parser fixes the broken syllabus-outcome extraction (was capturing the stem + a deadline line, missing all real CLOs) and consolidates the 3 outcome paths; `rubric_recommender` now hard-gates on CLO discovery (`--allow-generic` overrides). (c) **`clo_quality_audit.py`** scores discovered CLOs against the AoL rubric, conservatively calibrated against real data (only `not_measurable`/`double_barreled` are hard flags; relevance/recency are human review). New shared `bloom_verbs.py` (resolves the blooms_taxonomy residual). **All read-only audits validated across 5 real courses with no false positives** (read-only against live courses — no sandbox import needed), spanning m119, ds460, ds250 (+ its blueprint) and itm327 (+ its blueprint and both sections). **Closes #30, #31, #32.** #33 (blueprint_exception_report labeling) deferred to a cleanup batch.
- **v0.23.0 just shipped** — **`syllabus_audit.py`** (read-only syllabus completeness audit), the first tool from the BYUI Learning & Teaching harvest. Audits a course's `syllabus_body` against the **9 required sections** of the BYU-Idaho syllabus template + a first-class **AI-policy REQUIRED gate** (BYUI now mandates a generative-AI statement per `byui.edu/ai`; Stoplight / AI-Assessment-Scale framework detection is advisory). Same evidence-based stance as the rubric tools: verdict driven only by deterministic section + AI-policy detection; bloat / outcomes-stated / Learning-Model signals are advisory data, not verdict-drivers; keyword "not detected" = review, not proven-absent. **Sandbox-first validated** (16/16 logic checks + live `CANVAS_SANDBOX_ID` run: 5/9 on a real syllabus, exit codes + `--json` confirmed). Grounded in the gitignored `pre_knowledge/byui_learning_teaching/byui_syllabus_guidance.md` + `byui_ai_hub.md`. **Harvest provenance:** Tier A+B BYUI portal harvest complete (syllabus template, APA Top-20, AI cluster of 5 posts → `byui_ai_agency.md`, the public `byui.edu/ai` hub → `byui_ai_hub.md`, EdTech-2026 → L8 New-Quizzes prevalence note now Instructure-wide). PTC text (Eaton Vol 1) indexed + deep-read deferred (internal-use-only, gitignored). **Open follow-ups:** (a) no tracked `knowledge/syllabus_knowledge.md` yet — the checklist lives in the tool; an institution-neutral distillation could be promoted later; (b) `clo_quality_audit.py` still wants the gated AoL CLO rubric. **Note:** `v0.22.0` (rubric_recommender, Stage 7) shipped without a prose entry here — this is its catch-up.
- **v0.21.0 just shipped** — **Rubrics workstream + Canvas-API knowledge architecture**, validated against real Canvas (ITM327 production + `CANVAS_SANDBOX_ID` ground-truth fixtures). **`rubrics_knowledge.md/.json` promoted to v1.0** — 4-criterion backbone meta-rubric (Criteria Alignment=validity / Rating Levels=reliability / Process-Oriented / Points & Weights), 4 typologies with exemption rules, AAC&U VALUE + Walvoord PTA + BYUI anchors; **Criterion 1 (alignment=validity) is evidence-based — data + human-review signal, not a verdict-driver** (lexical matching can't make a validity judgment). Catalogued in `knowledge/README.md`; wired into `canvas_course_expert.json`. **Two audit tools (sandbox-validated):** [`rubric_coverage_audit.py`](lib/tools/rubric_coverage_audit.py) (Stage 4 — coverage classifier: `has_rubric`/`decorative_rubric`/`missing_rubric`/`lti_external_tool`/`non_submittable`/`non_gradable`) and [`rubric_quality_audit.py`](lib/tools/rubric_quality_audit.py) (Stage 5 — backbone scoring; verdict from C2/C3/C4 + `validity_review` + `alignment` recommendations). Both `--json`-capable. **New write tool** [`sandbox_rubric_fixtures.py`](lib/tools/sandbox_rubric_fixtures.py) (seeds the validation fixture matrix; proved the rubric CREATE flow). **New project rule:** sandbox-first testing (Working Style). **Two knowledge files still v0.x** (partially exercised — keep until more surface validated): [`canvas_api_knowledge.md/.json`](lib/agents/knowledge/canvas_api_knowledge.md) v0.1 (Canvas-docs-only surface) and [`canvas_api_lessons_learned.md/.json`](lib/agents/knowledge/canvas_api_lessons_learned.md) v0.1 (16-lesson empirical companion; the `CANVAS_BASE_URL`-scheme footgun ITM327 hit was fixed across 6 tools this cycle). Post-Stage-6 backlog (deferred calibration, C1 semantic limits, recommender tool) is in the Active Context backlog bullet above. **Next:** rubric recommender (generative — propose CLO-aligned, Bloom-targeted rubrics for assignments lacking them; hybrid scaffold-now/agent-enrich-later).

- **v0.20.0 just shipped** — **#29 Phase 1** new `lib/tools/blueprint_orphan_pages.py` (read-only): post-sync Page-level integrity audit catching two Canvas behaviors the migration log silently masks. Detector A: 5-point fingerprint for Canvas's `-N` slug orphan pattern (sync re-pushes a locked page into a section that previously deleted its copy → Canvas creates `slug-2`/`-N` with canonical content but doesn't update the unsuffixed slug the module item still points at; students see stale, canonical material exists but is unreachable). Detector B: silent body reversion — section page body has no provenance in blueprint's revision history (the strongest signal; plain drift stays with `validate_blueprint_sync.py`). Detector B's behavior, reproduced deterministically 2026-05-20 on the lock-state-only sync path, **contradicts Canvas's published docs** ("Changed content will always overwrite the existing content in the associated courses for all locked objects") — operator warning printed when it fires, advising against lock-state-only Blueprint UI syncs until Canvas's behavior is understood. Two new External System Lessons added. **Phase 2** (`--apply` cleanup via unlock/write/re-lock cycle) is **deferred** — risk of leaving items half-unlocked on mid-sequence failure; needs Phase 1 detection exercised against real courses first. With this, the ITM-327 chain post-sync hygiene is fully covered: `validate_blueprint_sync` (drift), `blueprint_exception_report` (skipped items + reasons), `blueprint_orphan_pages` (orphans + reversions). Verification limit (honest): no live course in this repo — static + argparse only.
- **v0.19.0** — **#27** startup safety guard (closes the last open issue in the ITM-327 trigger → amplification → observability chain alongside #26 and #28). New shared module `lib/tools/canvas_course_guard.py` (pure functions, sibling to `canvas_pages.py` / `__toolbox_version__.py`): GETs `?include[]=total_students` + `/blueprint_subscriptions` per target course; hard-stops writes (`sys.exit(2)`) when the target is enrolled (`total_students > 0`) or a Blueprint child (non-empty subscriptions), unless `--allow-enrolled` is passed; advisory only on read modes; guard's own API errors never block (degraded-mode warn). Wired into 4 tools: `canvas_sync` (write on `--push`/`--upload`, advisory on `--pull`/`--status`/`--init`/`--pull-files`; `--build` skipped — local-only), `course_mirror` (source + target on `--push`), `blueprint_sync` (source + target on `--push`), `course_quality_check` (advisory-only — read-only audit). New External System Lesson added. `module_settings_sync` deliberately not wired (per P-007 + scope decision; can follow). Verification limit (honest, this session's discipline): no live course in this repo — static + argparse only.
- **v0.18.0** — **#28** new `lib/tools/blueprint_exception_report.py` (read-only): post-Blueprint-sync exception report per associated section — reads the subscriber-side migration-details endpoint Canvas exposes, groups by `conflicting_changes` type, emits PASS / WARN / FAIL with remediation guidance (FAIL on `content`/`deleted` → lock + resync; WARN on `points`/`state`/`settings`; PASS on `due_dates`/`availability_dates`). `--suggest-locks` emits a ready-to-run lock+resync script; `--report` writes markdown; `--migration-id <id>` inspects a historical migration. Resolves the Canvas footgun where `workflow_state: completed` is reported even when sections silently skipped majority of items via exceptions (real ITM-327 S2 incident: 51/80 items skipped with `completed` state). Pairs with `validate_blueprint_sync.py` — that tool sees STATE-DIFF (*what is*); this tool sees SYNC-LOG (*what happened, why, fix*). New External System Lesson added for the underlying Canvas behavior. Verification limit: end-to-end requires a live Blueprint sync; static + argparse only here.
- **v0.17.0** — **#25 fully closed** (mapping: Part 1 vendored-tool drift → version stamp + `--version` + documented re-sync, delivered v0.16.0; Part 2 `module_settings_sync` de-hardcoding → policy layer `076d466` + surface args `82c4278`: `--target` / `--module-prefix` / `--rename-match`, rename-discovery now opt-in, `"performance review"` literal removed, ITM-327 reproduced via explicit flags; Part 3 Canvas clear-quirk → documented via #26). Also: new procedural knowledge `evidence_centered_design_knowledge` (`v0.1`/untested — its own knowledge-file version scale; promoted to `1.0` only after a real-course test; not yet catalogued or wired into agent `cross_references[]` per the `0.x` convention); `module_structure_diff.py` documented as a general read-only diagnostic + docstring de-misleadinged; keystone-uv project half (`.python-version` = `3.14`). Upstream this cycle: Make-AI-Agents #13/#14/#15 (make_AGENTS workflow block; make_agent_knowledge section-order contradiction + optional-section list).
- **v0.16.0** — versioning coherence + vendored-tool drift visibility: added `lib/tools/__toolbox_version__.py` as the single source of truth and a `--version` flag on the four primary sync tools (`canvas_sync`, `blueprint_sync`, `course_mirror`, `module_settings_sync`). Reconciled the version landscape (stale "v0.14.0 just shipped" marker, a divergent `v1.x` tag series, no constant). Folded in the then-unreleased **#26** idempotent Page upsert (`canvas_pages.py` shared module) and **#25 Part 2 policy layer** (`module_settings_sync --policy`).
- **v0.14.0** — agent retrofit series R3–R6: all 6 consuming agents migrated from template v3.1 → v3.6 behavioral-discipline contract. Each agent now declares `interaction_pattern`, a full `behavioral_discipline` object (applicable principles + no-override + override decisions + BD-QC checks), and `cross_references.knowledge_files[]` per the v3.6 contract. Patterns surfaced: `single_write_workflow` (canvas_course_expert, canvas_content_sync); `multi_step_batch` (canvas_schedule_auditor, canvas_semester_setup, canvas_blueprint_sync); `conversational` (ira_program_alignment, with documented P-005 `out_of_scope` override — the 5-phase workflow IS the small-steps decomposition). First non-LLM agent retrofit (canvas_blueprint_sync) introduced the `applies_to: "operator"` + `_qc_checks_na` pattern for deterministic scripts — captured upstream as [Make-AI-Agents#11](https://github.com/chaz-clark/Make-AI-Agents/issues/11). First conversational `.json` companion generated from scratch (ira_program_alignment had no prior JSON). Per-retrofit commits: R3 `7d5ade6`, R4.1 `a4923b1`, R4.2 `8f8123b`, R4.3 `6818e10`, R5 `f8916bb`, R6 `58de57e`.
- **v0.13.0** — knowledge-framework expansion: 2 new pairs (`assessments_knowledge`, `backwards_design_knowledge` — Yale Poorvu + Hardman + Wiggins/McTighe UbD) and 10 JSON companion retrofits for all pre-existing framework MDs (CLT, Hattie, Three Domains, Taxonomy Explorer, Experiential, Designer Thinking, Course Design Language, Toyota Gap, Outcomes Quality, Inverted Bloom's). All JSONs declare `read_at_runtime` per selective-load access pattern. Knowledge catalog ([lib/agents/knowledge/README.md](lib/agents/knowledge/README.md)) updated. Source: Genchi Genbutsu pass from Make-AI-Agents (handoff 2026-05-13).
- **v0.12.0** — `validate_blueprint_sync.py` (post-Blueprint-sync validation: section drift, Blueprint field drift, duplicate detection, locked-item prerequisite check; live API, read-only, exits non-zero on findings; #24). Also: `course_quality_check.py` Blueprint-aware duplicate detection — Blueprint-locked copy is canonical, routes to `manual_review` instead of auto-deleting (#23). Canvas sync field gaps closed: quiz dates via linked assignment endpoint, discussion `todo_date`, assignment `name` on push, `allowed_extensions`, `omit_from_final_grade`, quiz metadata fields (#21, #22).
- **v0.9.0** — `course_quality_check.py --validate-dates` (out-of-window, ordering sanity, duplicate due dates per group, label-vs-week/sprint drift; read-only, exits non-zero on findings; #20). Also: repo restructured into `lib/` / `scaffold/` / `examples/` for pull-safe boundaries (#19).
- **v0.6.0 / 0.7.0 / 0.8.0** — three independent opt-in audit/sync features:
  - `canvas_sync.py --pull-files` / `--find-file` / `--pull-file` (file-aware pulling, fuzzy search, pre-download confirmation thresholds; #16)
  - `course_quality_check.py --files` (orphan + broken-reference + duplicate audit, read-only; #17)
  - `course_quality_check.py --alignment` (Course Outcome → Module Outcome → Rubric Criterion chain audit, read-only; #18)
- **Open canvas_toolbox issues**: none. Issue tracker is empty — ready for empirical validation against real courses.
- **v0.5.0** — Course Design Language as the 8th knowledge framework, with the `byui_course_design/` template-set (11 HTML components + canonical rubric JSON)
- **v0.4.0 multi-course orchestration** in production — `lib/tools/sync_context.sh` invokes `canvas_sync.py` per context (master/blueprint/s1/s2/...). Validated against a real multi-section course setup.
- **Make-AI-Agents clone** at `Make-AI-Agents/` is gitignored. Populate locally with the `git clone` command in Existing Tooling when needed.
- **Roadmap (canvas_toolbox)**: convert `canvas_course_expert` to deployable `.agents/skills/canvas-audit/` (first deployable skill, parameterize for non-BYUI institutions); capture conversion as `lib/agents/deploy_agent.md`; convert `canvas_schedule_auditor` to validate the template; cite `toyota-way-agents` skill from AGENTS.md once it lands upstream and gets cloned in.
- **Upstream-tracked work** lives in [`Make-AI-Agents`](https://github.com/chaz-clark/Make-AI-Agents) (separate repo, separate issue tracker). Toyota Way × AI agents skill design + clone consumer hygiene live there.

Vision: another university clones this repo, opens it in any modern AI coding tool, and the canvas-audit capability is auto-discovered by their LLM — zero install friction beyond clone-and-open.
